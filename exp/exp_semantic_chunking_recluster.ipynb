      "['History Of Ancient\\nCivilization\\n\\n by\\nCharles Seignobos\\nHistory Of Ancient Civilization\\nCHAPTER I\\nTHE ORIGINS OF CIVILIZATION\\nPREHISTORIC ARCHÃ†OLOGY\\nPrehistoric Remains. â€”One often finds buried in the earth, weapons,\\nimplements, human skeletons, dÃ©bris of every kind left by men of whom\\nwe have no direct knowledge. These are dug up by the thousand in all the\\nprovinces of France, in Switzerland, in England, in all Europe; they are\\nfound even in Asia and Africa.', 'It is probable that they exist in all parts of\\nthe world. These remains are called prehistoric because they are more ancient than\\nwritten history. For about fifty years men have been engaged in recovering\\nand studying them.', 'Today most museums have a hall, or at least, some\\ncases filled with these relics. A museum at Saint-German-en-Laye, near\\nParis, is entirely given up to prehistoric remains. In Denmark is a collection\\nof more than 30,000 objects.', 'Every day adds to the discoveries as\\nexcavations are made, houses built, and cuts made for railroads. These objects are not found on the surface of the ground, but ordinarily\\nburied deeply where the earth has not been disturbed. They are recovered\\nfrom a stratum of gravel or clay which has been deposited gradually and\\nhas fixed them in place safe from the air, a sure proof that they have been\\nthere for a long time.', 'Prehistoric Science. â€”Scholars have examined the dÃ©bris and have asked\\nthemselves what men have left them. From their skeletons, they have tried\\nto construct their physical appearance; from their tools, the kind of life they\\nled.', 'They have determined that these instruments resemble those used by\\ncertain savages today. The study of all these objects constitutes a new\\nscience, Prehistoric ArchÃ¦ology. The Four Ages.', 'â€”Prehistoric remains come down to us from very diverse\\nraces of men; they have been deposited in the soil at widely different\\nepochs since the time when the mammoth lived in western Europe, a sort\\nof gigantic elephant with woolly hide and curved tusks. This long lapse of\\ntime may be divided into four periods, called Ages:\\n1. The Rough Stone Age.', '2. The Polished Stone Age. 3.', 'The Bronze Age. 4. The Iron Age.', 'The periods take their names from the materials used in the manufacture of\\nthe tools,â€”stone, bronze, iron. These epochs, however, are of very unequal\\nlength. It may be that the Rough Stone Age was ten times as long as the\\nAge of Iron.', 'THE ROUGH STONE AGE\\nGravel DÃ©bris. â€”The oldest remains of the Stone Age have been found in\\nthe gravels. A French scholar found between 1841 and 1853, in the valley of\\nthe Somme, certain sharp instruments made of flint.', 'They were buried to a\\ndepth of six metres in gravel under three layers of clay, gravel, and marl\\nwhich had never been broken up. In the same place they discovered bones\\nof cattle, deer, and elephants. For a long time people made light of this\\ndiscovery.', 'They said that the chipping of the flints was due to chance. At\\nlast, in 1860, several scholars came to study the remains in the valley of the\\nSomme and recognized that the flints had certainly been cut by men. Since\\nthen there have been found more than 5,000 similar flints in strata of the\\nsame order either in the valley of the Seine or in England, and some of\\nthem by the side of human bones.', 'There is no longer any doubt that men\\nwere living at the epoch when the gravel strata were in process of\\nformation. If the strata that cover these remains have always been\\ndeposited as slowly as they are today, these men whose bones and tools we\\nunearth must have lived more than 200,000 years ago. The Cave Men.', 'â€”Remains are also found in caverns cut in rock, often above\\na river. The most noted are those on the banks of the VÃ©zÃ¨re, but they exist\\nin many other places. Sometimes they have been used as habitations and\\neven as graves for men.', 'Skeletons, weapons, and tools are found here\\ntogether. There are axes, knives, scrapers, lance-points of flint; arrows,\\nharpoon-points, needles of bone like those used by certain savages to this\\nday. The soil is strewn with the bones of animals which these men, untidy\\nlike all savages, threw into a corner after they had eaten the meat; they\\neven split the bones to extract the marrow just as savages do now.', 'Among\\nthe animals are found not only the hare, the deer, the ox, the horse, the\\nsalmon, but also the rhinoceros, the cave-bear, the mammoth, the elk, the\\nbison, the reindeer, which are all extinct or have long disappeared from\\nFrance. Some designs have been discovered engraved on the bone of a\\nreindeer or on the tusk of a mammoth. One of these represents a combat of\\nreindeer; another a mammoth with woolly hide and curved tusks.', 'Doubtless these men were the contemporaries of the mammoth and the\\nreindeer. They were, like the Esquimaux of our day, a race of hunters and\\nfishermen, knowing how to work in flint and to kindle fires. POLISHED STONE AGE\\nLake Dwellings.', 'â€”In 1854, Lake Zurich being very low on account of the\\nunusual dryness of the summer, dwellers on the shore of the lake found, in\\nthe mud, wooden piles which had been much eaten away, also some rude\\nutensils. These were the remains of an ancient village built over the water. Since this time more than 200 similar villages have been found in the lakes\\nof Switzerland.', 'They have been called Lake Villages. The piles on which\\nthey rest are trunks of trees, pointed and driven into the lake-bottom to a\\ndepth of several yards. Every village required 30,000 to 40,000 of these.', 'A wooden platform was supported by the pile work and on this were built\\nwooden houses covered with turf. Objects found by the hundred among\\nthe piles reveal the character of the life of the former inhabitants. They ate\\nanimals killed in the chaseâ€”the deer, the boar, and the elk.', 'But they were\\nalready acquainted with such domestic animals as the ox, the goat, the\\nsheep, and the dog. They knew how to till the ground, to reap, and to grind\\ntheir grain; for in the ruins of their villages are to be found grains of wheat\\nand even fragments of bread, or rather unleavend cakes. They wore coarse\\ncloths of hemp and sewed them into garments with needles of bone.', 'They\\nmade pottery but were very awkward in its manufacture. Their vases were\\npoorly burned, turned by hand, and adorned with but few lines. Like the\\ncave-men, they used knives and arrows of flint; but they made their axes of\\na very hard stone which they had learned to polish.', 'This is why we call\\ntheir epoch the Polished Stone Age. They are much later than the cavemen, for they know neither the mammoth nor the rhinoceros, but still are\\nacquainted with the elk and the reindeer. Megalithic Monuments.', 'â€”Megalith is the name given to a monument\\nformed of enormous blocks of rough stone. Sometimes the rock is bare,\\nsometimes covered with a mass of earth. The buried monument is called a\\nTumulus on account of its resemblance to a hill.', 'When it is opened, one\\nfinds within a chamber of rock, sometimes paved with flag-stones. The\\nmonuments whose stone is above ground are of various sorts. The Dolmen,\\nor table of rock, is formed of a long stone laid flat over other stones set in\\nthe ground.', 'The Cromlech, or stone-circle, consists of massive rocks\\narranged in a circle. The Menhir is a block of stone standing on its end. Frequently several menhirs are ranged in line.', 'At Carnac in Brittany four\\nthousand menhirs in eleven rows are still standing. Probably there were\\nonce ten thousand of these in this locality. Megalithic monuments appear\\nby hundreds in western France, especially in Brittany; almost every hill in\\nEngland has them; the Orkney Islands alone contain more than two\\nthousand.', 'Denmark and North Germany are studded with them; the\\npeople of the country call the tumuli the tombs of the giants. Megalithic monuments are encountered outside of Europeâ€”in India, and\\non the African coast. No one knows what people possessed the power to\\nquarry such masses and then transport and erect them.', 'For a long time it\\nwas believed that the people were the ancient Gauls, or Celts, whence the\\nname Celtic Monuments. But why are like remains found in Africa and in\\nIndia?\\nWhen one of these tumuli still intact is opened, one always sees a skeleton,\\noften several, either sitting or reclining; these monuments, therefore, were\\nused as tombs. Arms, vases, and ornaments are placed at the side of the\\ndead.', 'In the oldest of these tombs the weapons are axes of polished stone;\\nthe ornaments are shells, pearls, necklaces of bone or ivory; the vases are\\nvery simple, without handle or neck, decorated only with lines or with\\npoints. Calcined bones of animals lie about on the ground, the relics of a\\nfuneral repast laid in the tomb by the friends of the dead. Amidst these\\nbones we no longer find those of the reindeer, a fact which proves that\\nthese monuments were constructed after the disappearance of this animal\\nfrom western Europe, and therefore at a time subsequent to that of the lake\\nvillages.', 'THE AGE OF BRONZE\\nBronze Age. â€”As soon as men learned to smelt metals, they preferred these\\nto stone in the manufacture of weapons. The metal first to be used was\\ncopper, easier to extract because found free, and easier to manipulate since\\nit is malleable without the application of heat.', 'Pure copper, however, was\\nnot employed, as weapons made of it were too fragile; but a little tin was\\nmixed with it to give it more resistance. It is this alloy of copper and tin\\nthat we call bronze. Bronze Utensils.', 'â€”Bronze was used in the manufacture of ordinary toolsâ€”\\nknives, hammers, saws, needles, fish-hooks; in the fabrication of\\nornamentsâ€”bracelets, brooches, ear-rings; and especially in the making of\\narmsâ€”daggers, lance-points, axes, and swords. These objects are found by\\nthousands throughout Europe in the mounds, under the more recent\\ndolmens, in the turf-pits of Denmark, and in rock-tombs. Near these objects\\nof bronze, ornaments of gold are often seen and, now and then, the remains\\nof a woollen garment.', 'It cannot be due to chance that all implements of\\nbronze are similar and all are made according to the same alloy. Doubtless\\nthey revert to the same period of time and are anterior to the coming of the\\nRomans into Gaul, for they are never discovered in the midst of dÃ©bris of\\nthe Roman period. But what men used them? What people invented\\nbronze? Nobody knows.', 'THE IRON AGE\\nIron. â€”As iron was harder to smelt and work than bronze, it was later that\\nmen learned how to use it. As soon as it was appreciated that iron was\\nharder and cut better than bronze, men preferred it in the manufacture of\\narms.', \"In Homer's time iron is still a precious metal reserved for swords,\\nbronze being retained for other purposes. It is for this reason that many\\ntombs contain confused remains of utensils of bronze and weapons of iron. Iron Weapons.\", 'â€”These arms are axes, swords, daggers, and bucklers. They\\nare ordinarily found by the side of a skeleton in a coffin of stone or wood,\\nfor warriors had their arms buried with them. But they are found also\\nscattered on ancient battle-fields or lost at the bottom of a marsh which\\nlater became a turf-pit.', 'There were found in a turf-pit in Schleswig in one\\nday 100 swords, 500 lances, 30 axes, 460 daggers, 80 knives, 40 stilettosâ€”\\nand all of iron. Not far from there in the bed of an ancient lake was\\ndiscovered a great boat 66 feet long, fully equipped with axes, swords,\\nlances, and knives. It is impossible to enumerate the iron implements thus found.', 'They have\\nnot been so well preserved as the bronze, as iron is rapidly eaten away by\\nrust. At the first glance, therefore, they appear the older, but in reality are\\nmore recent. Epoch of the Iron Age.', 'â€”The inhabitants of northern Europe knew iron\\nbefore the coming of the Romans, the first century before Christ. In an old\\ncemetery near the salt mines of Hallstadt in Austria they have opened 980\\ntombs filled with instruments of iron and bronze without finding a single\\npiece of Roman money. But the Iron Age continued under the Romans.', 'Almost always iron objects are found accompanied by ornaments of gold\\nand silver, by Roman pottery, funeral urns, inscriptions, and Roman coins\\nbearing the effigy of the emperor. The warriors whom we find lying near\\ntheir sword and their buckler lived for the most part in a period quite close\\nto ours, many under the Merovingians, some even at the time of\\nCharlemagne. The Iron Age is no longer a prehistoric age.', 'CONCLUSIONS\\nHow the Four Ages are to be Conceived. â€”The inhabitants of one and the\\nsame country have successively made use of rough stone, polished stone,\\nbronze, and iron. But all countries have not lived in the same age at the\\nsame time.', 'Iron was employed by the Egyptians while yet the Greeks were\\nin their bronze age and the barbarians of Denmark were using stone. The\\nconclusion of the polished stone age in America came only with the arrival\\nof Europeans. In our own time the savages of Australia are still in the\\nrough stone age.', 'In their settlements may be found only implements of\\nbone and stone similar to those used by the cave-men. The four ages,\\ntherefore, do not mark periods in the life of humanity, but only epochs in\\nthe civilization of each country. Uncertainties.', 'â€”Prehistoric archÃ¦ology is yet a very young science. We\\nhave learned something of primitive men through certain remains\\npreserved and discovered by chance. A recent accident, a trench, a landslip,\\na drought may effect a new discovery any day.', 'Who knows what is still\\nunder ground? The finds are already innumerable. But these rarely tell us\\nwhat we wish to know. How long was each of the four ages? When did\\neach begin and end in the various parts of the world? Who planned the\\ncaverns, the lake villages, the mounds, the dolmens? When a country\\npasses from polished stone to bronze, is it the same people changing\\nimplements, or is it a new people come on the scene? When one thinks one\\nhas found the solution, a new discovery often confounds the archÃ¦ologists.', 'It was thought that the Celts originated the dolmens, but these have been\\nfound in sections which could never have been traversed by Celts. What has been determined. â€”Three conclusions, however, seem certain:\\n1.', \"â€”Man has lived long on the earth, familiar as he was with the mammoth\\nand the cave-bear; he lived at least as early as the geological period known\\nas the Quaternary. 2. â€”Man has emerged from the savage state to civilized life; he has\\ngradually perfected his tools and his ornaments from the awkward axe of\\nflint and the necklace of bears' teeth to iron swords and jewels of gold.\", 'The\\nroughest instruments are the oldest. 3. â€”Man has made more and more rapid progress.', 'Each age has been\\nshorter than its predecessor. CHAPTER II\\nHISTORY AND THE RECORDS\\nHISTORY\\nLegends. â€”The most ancient records of people and their doings are\\ntransmitted by oral tradition.', 'They are recited long before they are written\\ndown and are much mixed with fable. The Greeks told how their heroes of\\nthe oldest times had exterminated monsters, fought with giants, and\\nbattled against the gods. The Romans had Romulus nourished by a wolf\\nand raised to heaven.', 'Almost all peoples relate such stories of their infancy. But no confidence is to be placed in these legends. History.', 'â€”History has its true beginning only with authentic accounts, that\\nis to say, accounts written by men who were well informed. This moment\\nis not the same with all peoples. The history of Egypt commences more\\nthan 3,000 years before Christ; that of the Greeks ascends scarcely to 800\\nyears before Christ; Germany has had a history only since the first century\\nof our era; Russia dates back only to the ninth century; certain savage tribes\\neven yet have no history.', 'Great Divisions of History. â€”The history of civilization begins with the\\noldest civilized people and continues to the present time. Antiquity is the\\nmost remote period, Modern Times the era in which we live.', 'Ancient History. â€”Ancient History begins with the oldest known nations,\\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans (about 3,000 years before our era), and\\nsurveys the peoples of the Orient, the Hindoos, Persians, PhÅ“nicians, Jews,\\nGreeks, and last of all the Romans. It terminates about the fifth century\\nA.', 'D. , when the Roman empire of the west is extinguished. Modern History.', 'â€”Modern History starts with the end of the fifteenth\\ncentury, with the invention of printing, the discovery of America and of the\\nIndies, the Renaissance of the sciences and arts. It concerns itself especially\\nwith peoples of the West, of Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, and\\nAmerica. The Middle Age.', 'â€”Between Antiquity and Modern Times about ten\\ncenturies elapse which belong neither to ancient times (for the civilization\\nof Antiquity has perished) nor to modern (since modern civilization does\\nnot yet exist). This period we call the Middle Age. SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT\\nPEOPLES\\nThe Sources.', 'â€”The Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans are no longer with us;\\nall the peoples of antiquity have passed away. To know their religion, their\\ncustoms, and arts we have to seek for instruction in the remains they have\\nleft us. These are books, monuments, inscriptions, and languages, and\\nthese are our means for the study of ancient civilizations.', 'We term these\\nsources because we draw our knowledge from them. Ancient History flows\\nfrom these sources. Books.', 'â€”Ancient peoples have left written records behind them. Some of\\nthese peoples had sacred booksâ€”for example, the Hindoos, the Persians,\\nand the Jews; the Greeks and Romans have handed down to us histories,\\npoems, speeches, philosophical treatises. But books are very far from\\nfurnishing all the information that we require.', 'We do not possess a single\\nAssyrian or PhÅ“nician book. Other peoples have transmitted very few\\nbooks to us. The ancients wrote less than we, and so they had a smaller\\nliterature to leave behind them; and as it was necessary to transcribe all of\\nthis by hand, there was but a small number of copies of books.', 'Further,\\nmost of these manuscripts have been destroyed or have been lost, and\\nthose which remain to us are difficult to read. The art of deciphering them\\nis called PalÃ¦ography. The Monuments.', 'â€”Ancient peoples, like ourselves, built monuments of\\ndifferent sorts: palaces for their kings, tombs for the dead, fortresses,\\nbridges, aqueducts, triumphal arches. Of these monuments many have\\nfallen into ruin, have been razed, shattered by the enemy or by the people\\nthemselves. But some of them survive, either because there was no desire\\nto destroy them, or because men could not.', 'They still stand in ruins like the\\nold castles, for repairs are no longer made; but enough is preserved to\\nenable us to comprehend their former condition. Some of them are still\\nabove ground, like the pyramids, the temples of Thebes and of the island of\\nPhilÃ¦, the palace of Persepolis in Persia, the Parthenon in Greece, the\\nColosseum in Rome, and the Maison CarrÃ©e and Pont du Gard in France. Like any modern monument, these are visible to the traveller.', 'But the\\nmajority of these monuments have been recovered from the earth, from\\nsand, from river deposits, and from dÃ©bris. One must disengage them from\\nthis thick covering, and excavate the soil, often to a great depth. Assyrian\\npalaces may be reached only by cutting into the hills.', 'A trench of forty feet\\nis necessary to penetrate to the tombs of the kings of MycenÃ¦. Time is not\\nthe only agency for covering these ruins; men have aided it. When the\\nancients wished to build, they did not, as we do, take the trouble to level\\noff the space, nor to clear the site.', 'Instead of removing the dÃ©bris, they\\nheaped it together and built above it. The new edifice in turn fell into ruins\\nand its dÃ©bris was added to that of more remote time; thus there were\\nformed several strata of remains. When Schliemann excavated the site of\\nTroy, he had passed through five beds of dÃ©bris; these were five ruined\\nvillages one above another, the oldest at a depth of fifty feet.', 'By accident one town has been preserved to us in its entirety. In 79 A. D.', 'the\\nvolcano of Vesuvius belched forth a torrent of liquid lava and a rain of\\nashes, and two Roman cities were suddenly buried, Herculaneum by lava,\\nand Pompeii by ashes; the lava burnt the objects it touched, while the ashes\\nenveloped them, preserving them from the air and keeping them intact. As\\nwe remove the ashes, Pompeii reappears to us just as it was eighteen\\ncenturies ago. One still sees the wheel-ruts in the pavement, the designs\\ntraced on the walls with charcoal; in the houses, the pictures, the utensils,\\nthe furniture, even the bread, the nuts, and olives, and here and there the\\nskeleton of an inhabitant surprised by the catastrophe.', 'Monuments teach\\nusmuch about the ancient peoples. The science of monuments is called\\nArchÃ¦ology. Inscriptions.', 'â€”By inscriptions one means all writings other than books. Inscriptions are for the most part cut in stone, but some are on plates of\\nbronze. At Pompeii they have been found traced on the walls in colors or\\nwith charcoal.', 'Some have the character of commemorative inscriptions just\\nas these are now attached to our statues and edifices; thus in the\\nmonument of Ancyra the emperor Augustus publishes the story of his life. The greatest number of inscriptions are epitaphs graven on tombs. Certain\\nothers fill the function of our placards, containing, as they do, a law or a\\nregulation that was to be made public.', 'The science of inscriptions is called\\nEpigraphy. Languages. â€”The languages also which ancient peoples spoke throw light\\non their history.', 'Comparing the words of two different languages, we\\nperceive that the two have a common originâ€”an evidence that the peoples\\nwho spoke them were descended from the same stock. The science of\\nlanguages is called Linguistics. LacunÃ¦.', 'â€”It is not to be supposed that books, monuments, inscriptions,\\nand languages are sufficient to give complete knowledge of the history of\\nantiquity. They present many details which we could well afford to lose,\\nbut often what we care most to know escapes us. Scholars continue to dig\\nand to decipher; each year new discoveries of inscriptions and monuments\\nare made; but there remain still many gaps in our knowledge and probably\\nsome of these will always exist.', 'RACES AND PEOPLES\\nAnthropology. â€”The men who people the earth do not possess exact\\nresemblances, some differing from others in stature, the form of the limbs\\nand the head, the features of the face, the color of the hair and eyes. Other\\ndifferences are found in language, intelligence, and sentiments.', 'These\\nvariations permit us to separate the inhabitants of the earth into several\\ngroups which we call races. A race is the aggregate of those men who\\nresemble one another and are distinguished from all others. The common\\ntraits of a raceâ€”its characteristicsâ€”constitute the type of the race.', 'For\\nexample, the type of the negro race is marked by black skin, frizzly hair,\\nwhite teeth, flat nose, projecting lips, and prominent jaw. That part of\\nAnthropology which concerns itself with races and their sub-divisions is\\ncalled Ethnology. This science is yet in its early development on account of\\nits complete novelty, and is very complex since types of men are very\\nnumerous and often very difficult to differentiate.', 'The Races. â€”The principal races are:\\n1. â€”The White race, which inhabits Europe, the north of Africa, and\\nwestern Asia.', '2. â€”The Yellow race in eastern Asia to which belong the Chinese, the\\nMongols, Turks, and Hungarians, who invaded Europe as conquerors. They have yellow skin, small regular eyes, prominent cheek-bones, and\\nthin beard.', '3. â€”The Black race, in central Africa. These are the Negroes, of black skin,\\nflat nose, woolly hair.', '4. â€”The Red race, in America. These are the Indians, with copper-colored\\nskin and flat heads.', 'Civilized Peoples. â€”Almost all civilized peoples belong to the white race. The peoples of the other races have remained savage or barbarian, like the\\nmen of prehistoric times.', 'It is within the limits of Asia and Africa that the first civilized peoples had\\ntheir developmentâ€”the Egyptians in the Nile valley, the Chaldeans in the\\nplain of the Euphrates. They were peoples of sedentary and peaceful\\npursuits. Their skin was dark, the hair short and thick, the lips strong.', 'Nobody knows their origin with exactness and scholars are not agreed on\\nthe name to give them (some terming them Cushites, others Hamites). Later, between the twentieth and twenty-fifth centuries B. C.', 'came bands of\\nmartial shepherds who had spread over all Europe and the west of Asiaâ€”\\nthe Aryans and the Semites. The Aryans and the Semites. â€”There is no clearly marked external\\ndifference between the Aryans and the Semites.', 'Both are of the white race,\\nhaving the oval face, regular features, clear skin, abundant hair, large eyes,\\nthin lips, and straight nose. Both peoples were originally nomad\\nshepherds, fond of war. We do not know whence they came, nor is there\\nagreement whether the Aryans came from the mountain region in the\\nnorthwest of the Himalayas or from the plains of Russia.', 'What\\ndistinguishes them is their spiritual bent and especially their language,\\nsometimes also their religion. Scholars by common consent call those\\npeoples Aryan who speak an Aryan language: in Asia, the Hindoos and\\nPersians; in Europe, the Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Germans,\\nScandinavians, Slavs (Russians, Poles, Serfs), and Celts. Similarly, we call Semites those peoples who speak a Semitic language:\\nArabs, Jews and Syrians.', 'But a people may speak an Aryan or a Semitic\\nlanguage and yet not be of Aryan or Semitic race; a negro may speak\\nEnglish without being of English stock. Many of the Europeans whom we\\nclassify among the Aryans are perhaps the descendants of an ancient race\\nconquered by the Aryans and who have adopted their language, just as the\\nEgyptians received the language of the Arabs, their conquerors. These two names (Aryan and Semite), then, signify today rather two\\ngroups of peoples than two distinct races.', 'But even if we use the terms in\\nthis sense, one may say that all the greater peoples of the world have been\\nSemites or Aryans. The Semitic family included the PhÅ“nicians, the people\\nof commerce; the Jews, the people of religion; the Arabs, the people of war. The Aryans, some finding their homes in India, others in Europe, have\\nproduced the nations which have been, and still are, foremost in the\\nworldâ€”in antiquity, the Hindoos, a people of great philosophical and\\nreligious ideas; the Greeks, creators of art and of science; the Persians and\\nRomans, the founders, the former in the East, the latter in the West, of the\\ngreatest empires of antiquity; in modern times, the Italians, French,\\nGermans, Dutch, Russians, English and Americans.', 'The history of civilization begins with the Egyptians and the Chaldeans;\\nbut from the fifteenth century before our era, history concerns itself only\\nwith the Aryan and Semitic peoples. CHAPTER III\\nANCIENT HISTORY OF THE EAST\\nTHE EGYPTIANS\\nThe Land of Egypt. â€”Egypt is only the valley of the Nile, a narrow strip of\\nfertile soil stretching along both banks of the stream and shut in by\\nmountains on either side, somewhat over 700 miles in length and 15 in\\nwidth.', 'Where the hills fall away, the Delta begins, a vast plain cut by the\\narms of the Nile and by canals. As Herodotus says, Egypt is wholly the gift\\nof the Nile. The Nile.', 'â€”Every year at the summer solstice the Nile, swollen by the\\nmelted snows of Abyssinia, overflows the parched soil of Egypt. It rises to\\na height of twenty-six or twenty-seven feet, sometimes even to thirty-three\\nfeet. The whole country becomes a lake from which the villages, built on\\neminences, emerge like little islands.', 'The water recedes in September; by\\nDecember it has returned to its proper channel. Everywhere has been left a\\nfertile, alluvial bed which serves the purpose of fertilization. On the\\nsoftened earth the peasant sows his crop with almost no labor.', 'The Nile,\\nthen, brings both water and soil to Egypt; if the river should fail, Egypt\\nwould revert, like the land on either side of it, to a desert of sterile sand\\nwhere the rain never falls. The Egyptians are conscious of their debt to their\\nstream. A song in its honor runs as follows: \"Greeting to thee, O Nile, who\\nhast revealed thyself throughout the land, who comest in peace to give life\\nto Egypt.', 'Does it rise? The land is filled with joy, every heart exults, every\\nbeing receives its food, every mouth is full. It brings bounties that are full\\nof delight, it creates all good things, it makes the grass to spring up for the\\nbeasts. \"\\nFertility of the Country.', 'â€”Egypt is truly an oasis in the midst of the desert\\nof Africa. It produces in abundance wheat, beans, lentils, and all\\nleguminous foods; palms rear themselves in forests. On the pastures\\nirrigated by the Nile graze herds of cattle and goats, and flocks of geese.', 'With a territory hardly equal to that of Belgium, Egypt still supports\\n5,500,000 inhabitants. No country in Europe is so thickly populated, and\\nEgypt in antiquity was more densely thronged than it is today. The Accounts of Herodotus.', 'â€”Egypt was better known to the Greeks than\\nthe rest of the Orient. Herodotus had visited it in the fifth century B. C.', 'He\\ndescribes in his History the inundations of the Nile, the manners, costume,\\nand religion of the people; he recounts events of their history and tales\\nwhich his guides had told him. Diodorus and Strabo also speak of Egypt. But all had seen the country in its decadence and had no knowledge of the\\nancient Egyptians.', 'Champollion. â€”The French expedition to Egypt (1798-1801) opened the\\ncountry to scholars. They made a close examination of the Pyramids and\\nruins of Thebes, and collected drawings and inscriptions.', 'But no one could\\ndecipher the hieroglyphs, the Egyptian writing. It was an erroneous\\nimpression that every sign in this writing must each represent a word. In\\n1821 a French scholar, Champollion, experimented with another system.', 'An official had reported that there was an inscription at Rosetta in three\\nforms of writingâ€”parallel with the hieroglyphs was a translation in Greek. The name of King Ptolemy, was surrounded with a cartouche. Champollion succeeded in finding in this name the letters P, T, O, L, M, I,\\nS.', 'Comparing these with other names of kings similarly enclosed, he found\\nthe whole alphabet. He then read the hieroglyphs and found that they were\\nwritten in a language like the Coptic, the language spoken in Egypt at the\\ntime of the Romans, and which was already known to scholars. Egyptologists.', 'â€”Since Champollion, many scholars have travelled over\\nEgypt and have ransacked it thoroughly. We call these students\\nEgyptologists, and they are to be found in every country of Europe. A\\nFrench Egyptologist, Mariette (1821-1881), made some excavations for the\\nViceroy of Egypt and created the museum of Boulak.', 'France has\\nestablished in Cairo a school of Egyptology, directed by Maspero. Discoveries. â€”Not every country yields such rich discoveries as does\\nEgypt.', 'The Egyptians constructed their tombs like houses, and laid in them\\nobjects of every kind for the use of the deadâ€”furniture, garments, arms,\\nand edibles. The whole country was filled with tombs similarly furnished. Under this extraordinarily dry climate everything has been preserved;\\nobjects come to light intact after a burial of 4,000 or 5,000 years.', 'No people\\nof antiquity have left so many traces of themselves as the Egyptians; none\\nis better known to us. THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE\\nAntiquity of the Egyptian People. â€”An Egyptian priest said to Herodotus,\\n\"You Greeks are only children.', '\" The Egyptians considered themselves the\\noldest people of the world. Down to the Persian conquest (520 B. C.', ') there\\nwere twenty-six dynasties of kings. The first ran back 4,000 years, and\\nduring these forty centuries Egypt had been an empire. The capital down\\nto the tenth dynasty (the period of the Old Empire) was at Memphis in\\nLower Egypt, later, in the New Empire, at Thebes in Upper Egypt.', 'Memphis and the Pyramids. â€”Memphis, built by the first king of Egypt,\\nwas protected by an enormous dike. The village has existed for more than\\nfive thousand years; but since the thirteenth century the inhabitants have\\ntaken the stones of its ruins to build the houses of Cairo; what these people\\nleft the Nile recaptured.', 'The Pyramids, not far from Memphis, are\\ncontemporaneous with the old empire; they are the tombs of three kings of\\nthe fourth dynasty. The greatest of the pyramids, 480 feet high, required\\nthe labor of 100,000 men for thirty years. To raise the stones for it they built\\ngradually ascending platforms which were removed when the structure\\nwas completed.', 'Egyptian Civilization. â€”The statues, paintings, and instruments which are\\ntaken from the tombs of this epoch give evidence of an already civilized\\npeople. When all the other eminent nations of antiquityâ€”the Hindoos,\\nPersians, Jews, Greeks, Romansâ€”were still in a savage state, 3,500 years\\nbefore our era, the Egyptians had known for a long time how to cultivate\\nthe soil, to weave cloths, to work metals, to paint, sculpture, and to write;\\nthey had an organized religion, a king, and an administration.', 'Thebes. â€”At the eleventh dynasty Thebes succeeds Memphis as capital. The ruins of Thebes are still standing.', 'They are marvellous, extending as\\nthey do on both banks of the Nile, with a circuit of about seven miles. On\\nthe left bank there is a series of palaces and temples which lead to vast\\ncemeteries. On the right bank two villages, Luxor and Karnak, distant a\\nhalf-hour one from the other, are built in the midst of the ruins.', 'They are\\nunited by a double row of sphinxes, which must have once included more\\nthan 1,000 of these monuments. Among these temples in ruins the greatest\\nwas the temple of Ammon at Karnak. It was surrounded by a wall of over\\none and one-third miles in length; the famous Hall of Columns, the greatest\\nin the world, had a length of 334 feet, a width of 174 feet, and was\\nsupported by 134 columns; twelve of these are over 65 feet high.', 'Thebes\\nwas for 1,500 years the capital and sacred city, the residence of kings and\\nthe dwelling-place of the priests. The Pharaoh. â€”The king of Egypt, called Pharaoh, was esteemed as the son\\nof the Sun-god and his incarnation on earth; divinity was ascribed to him\\nalso.', 'We may see in a picture King Rameses II standing in adoration before\\nthe divine Rameses who is sitting between two gods. The king as man\\nadores himself as god. Being god, the Pharaoh has absolute power over\\nmen; as master, he gives his orders to his great nobles at court, to his\\nwarriors, to all his subjects.', 'But the priests, though adoring him, surround\\nand watch him; their head, the high priest of the god Ammon, at last\\nbecomes more powerful than the king; he often governs under the name of\\nthe king and in his stead. The Subjects of Pharaoh. â€”The king, the priests, the warriors, the nobles,\\nare proprietors of all Egypt; all the other people are simply their peasants\\nwho cultivate the land for them.', 'Scribes in the service of the king watch\\nthem and collect the farm-dues, often with blows of the staff. One of these\\nfunctionaries writes as follows to a friend, \"Have you ever pictured to\\nyourself the existence of the peasant who tills the soil. The tax-collector is\\non the platform busily seizing the tithe of the harvest.', 'He has his men with\\nhim armed with staves, his negroes provided with strips of palm. All cry,\\n\\'Come, give us grain,\\' If the peasant hasn\\'t it, they throw him full length on\\nthe earth, bind him, draw him to the canal, and hurl him in head foremost. \"\\nDespotism.', 'â€”The Egyptian people has always been, and still is, gay,\\ncareless, gentle, docile as an infant, always ready to submit to tyranny. In\\nthis country the cudgel was the instrument of education and of\\ngovernment. \"The young man,\" said the scribes, \"has a back to be beaten; he\\nhears when he is struck.', '\" \"One day,\" says a French traveller, \"finding\\nmyself before the ruins of Thebes, I exclaimed, \\'But how did they do all\\nthis?\\' My guide burst out laughing, touched me on the arm and, showing\\nme a palm, said to me, \\'Here is what they used to accomplish all this. You\\nknow, sir, with 100,000 branches of palms split on the backs of those who\\nalways have their shoulders bare, you can build many a palace and some\\ntemples to boot. \\'\"\\nIsolation of the Egyptians.', 'â€”The Egyptians moved but little beyond their\\nborders. As the sea inspired them with terror, they had no commerce and\\ndid not trade with other peoples. They were not at all a military nation.', 'Their kings, it is true, often went on expeditions at the head of mercenaries\\neither against the negroes of Ethiopia or against the tribes of Syria. They\\ngained victories which they had painted on the walls of their palaces, they\\nbrought back troops of captives whom they used in building monuments;\\nbut they never made great conquests. Foreigners came more to Egypt than\\nEgyptians went abroad.', 'Religion of the Egyptians. â€”\"The Egyptians,\" said Herodotus, \"are the most\\nreligious of all men. \" We do not know any people so devout; almost all\\ntheir paintings represent men in prayer before a god; almost all their\\nmanuscripts are religious books.', 'Egyptian Gods. â€”The principal deity is a Sun-god, creator, beneficent,\\n\"who knows all things, who exists from the beginning. \" This god has a\\ndivine wife and son.', 'All the Egyptians adored this trinity; but not all gave\\nit the same name. Each region gave a different name to these three gods. At\\nMemphis they called the father Phtah, the mother Sekhet, the son\\nImouthes; at Abydos they called them Osiris, Isis, and Horus; at Thebes,\\nAmmon, Mouth, and Chons.', 'Then, too, the people of one province adopted\\nthe gods of other provinces. Further, they made other gods emanate from\\neach god of the trinity. Thus the number of gods was increased and\\nreligion was complicated.', 'Osiris. â€”These gods have their history; it is that of the sun; for the sun\\nappeared to the Egyptians, as to most of the primitive peoples, the\\nmightiest of beings, and consequently a god. Osiris, the sun, is slain by Set,\\ngod of the night; Isis, the moon, his wife, bewails and buries him; Horus,\\nhis son, the rising sun, avenges him by killing his murderer.', 'Ammon-rÃ¢. â€”Ammon-rÃ¢, god of Thebes, is represented as traversing\\nheaven each day in a bark (\"the good bark of millions of years\"); the shades\\nof the dead propel it with long oars; the god stands at the prow to strike the\\nenemy with his lance. The hymn which they chanted in his honor is as\\nfollows: \"Homage to thee; thou watchest favoringly, thou watchest truly, O\\nmaster of the two horizons.', 'Thou treadest the heavens on high, thine\\nenemies are laid low. The heaven is glad, the earth is joyful, the gods unite\\nin festal cheer to render glory to RÃ¢ when they see him rising in his bark\\nafter he has overwhelmed his enemies. O RÃ¢, give abounding life to\\nPharaoh, bestow bread for his hunger (belly), water for his throat,\\nperfumes for his hair.', '\"\\nAnimal-Headed Gods. â€”The Egyptians often represented their gods with\\nhuman form, but more frequently under the form of a beast. Each god has\\nhis animal: Phtah incarnates himself in the beetle, Horus in the hawk,\\nOsiris in the bull.', 'The two figures often unite in a man with the head of an\\nanimal or an animal with the head of a man. Every god may be figured in\\nfour forms: Horus, for example, as a man, a hawk, as man with the head of\\na hawk, as a hawk with the head of a man. Sacred Animals.', 'â€”What did the Egyptians wish to designate by this\\nsymbol? One hardly knows. They, themselves, came to regard as sacred the\\nanimals which served to represent the gods to them: the bull, the beetle, the\\nibis, the hawk, the cat, the crocodile. They cared for them and protected\\nthem.', 'A century before the Christian era a Roman citizen killed a cat at\\nAlexandria; the people rose in riot, seized him, and, notwithstanding the\\nentreaties of the king, murdered him, although at the same time they had\\ngreat fear of the Romans. There was in each temple a sacred animal which\\nwas adored. The traveller Strabo records a visit to a sacred crocodile of\\nThebes: \"The beast,\" said he, \"lay on the edge of a pond, the priests drew\\nnear, two of them opened his mouth, a third thrust in cakes, grilled fish,\\nand a drink made with meal.', '\"\\nThe Bull Apis. â€”Of these animal gods the most venerated was the bull\\nApis. It represented at once Osiris and Phtah and lived at Memphis in a\\nchapel served by the priests.', 'After its death it became an Osiris (Osar-hapi),\\nit was embalmed, and its mummy deposited in a vault. The sepulchres of\\nthe \"Osar-hapi\" constituted a gigantic monument, the Serapeum,\\ndiscovered in 1851 by Marietta. Cult of the Dead.', 'â€”The Egyptians adored also the spirits of the dead. They\\nseem to have believed at first that every man had a \"double\" (KÃ¢), and that\\nwhen the man was dead his double still survived. Many savage peoples\\nbelieve this to this day.', 'The Egyptian tomb in the time of the Old Empire\\nwas termed \"House of the Double. \" It was a low room arranged like a\\nchamber, where for the service of the double there were placed all that he\\nrequired, chairs, tables, beds, chests, linen, closets, garments, toilet utensils,\\nweapons, sometimes a war-chariot; for the entertainment of the double,\\nstatues, paintings, books; for his sustenance, grain and foods. And then\\nthey set there a double of the dead in the form of a statue in wood or stone\\ncarved in his likeness.', 'At last the opening to the vault was sealed; the\\ndouble was enclosed, but the living still provided for him. They brought\\nhim foods or they might beseech a god that he supply them to the spirit, as\\nin this inscription, \"An offering to Osiris that he may confer on the KÃ¢ of\\nthe deceased N. bread, drink, meat, geese, milk, wine, beer, clothing,\\nperfumesâ€”all good things and pure on which the god (i.', 'e. the KÃ¢)\\nsubsists. \"\\nJudgment of the Soul.', 'â€”Later, originating with the eleventh dynasty, the\\nEgyptians believed that the soul flew away from the body and sought\\nOsiris under the earth, the realm into which the sun seemed every day to\\nsink. There Osiris sits on his tribunal, surrounded by forty-two judges; the\\nsoul appears before these to give account of his past life. His actions are\\nweighed in the balance of truth, his \"heart\" is called to witness.', '\"O heart,\"\\ncries the dead, \"O heart, the issue of my mother, my heart when I was on\\nearth, offer not thyself as witness, charge me not before the great god. \" The\\nsoul found on examination to be bad is tormented for centuries and at last\\nannihilated. The good soul springs up across the firmament; after many\\ntests it rejoins the company of the gods and is absorbed into them.', 'Mummies. â€”During this pilgrimage the soul may wish to re-enter the body\\nto rest there. The body must therefore be kept intact, and so the Egyptians\\nlearned to embalm it.', 'The corpse was filled with spices, drenched in a bath\\nof natron, wound with bandages and thus transformed into a mummy. The\\nmummy encased in a coffin of wood or plaster was laid in the tomb with\\nevery provision necessary to its life. Book of the Dead.', 'â€”A book was deposited with the mummy, the Book of\\nthe Dead, which explains what the soul ought to say in the other world\\nwhen it makes its defence before the tribunal of Osiris: \"I have never\\ncommitted fraud;. I have never vexed the widow;. I have never\\ncommitted any forbidden act;.', 'I have never been an idler;. I have never\\ntaken the slave from his master;. I never stole the bread from the temples;.', 'I never removed the provisions or the bandages of the dead; I never\\naltered the grain measure;. I never hunted sacred beasts; I never caught\\nsacred fish;. I am pure;.', 'I have given bread to the hungry, water to the\\nthirsty, clothing to the naked; I have sacrificed to the gods, and offered\\nfuneral feasts to dead. \" Here we see Egyptian morality: observance of\\nceremonies, respect for everything pertaining to the gods, sincerity,\\nhonesty, and beneficence. THE ARTS\\nIndustry.', 'â€”The Egyptians were the first to practice the arts necessary to a\\ncivilized people. From the first dynasty, 3,000 years B. C.', ', paintings on the\\ntomb exhibit men working, sowing, harvesting, beating and winnowing\\ngrain; we have representations of herds of cattle, sheep, geese, swine; of\\npersons richly clothed, processions, feasts where the harp is playedâ€”\\nalmost the same life that we behold 3,000 years later. As early as this time\\nthe Egyptians knew how to manipulate gold, silver, bronze; to\\nmanufacture arms and jewels, glass, pottery, and enamel; they wove\\ngarments of linen and wool, and cloths, transparent or embroidered with\\ngold. Architecture.', 'â€”They were the oldest artists of the world. They constructed\\nenormous monuments which appear to be eternal, for down to the present,\\ntime has not been able to destroy them. They never built, as we do, for the\\nliving, but for the gods and for the dead, i.', 'e. , temples and tombs. Only a\\nslight amount of dÃ©bris is left of their houses, and even the palaces of their\\nkings in comparison with the tombs appear, in the language of the Greeks,\\nto be only inns.', 'The house was to serve only for a lifetime, the tomb for\\neternity. Tombs. â€”The Great Pyramid is a royal tomb.', 'Ancient tombs ordinarily had\\nthis form. In Lower Egypt there still remain pyramids arranged in rows or\\nscattered about, some larger, others smaller. These are the tombs of kings\\nand nobles.', 'Later the tombs are constructed underground, some under\\nearth, others cut into the granite of the hills. Each generation needs new\\nones, and therefore near the town of living people is built the richer and\\ngreater city of the dead (necropolis). Temples.', 'â€”The gods also required eternal and splendid habitations. Their\\ntemples include a magnificent sanctuary, the dwelling of the god,\\nsurrounded with courts, gardens, chambers where the priests lodge,\\nwardrobes for his jewels, utensils, and vestments. This combination of\\nedifices, the work of many generations, is encircled with a wall.', 'The temple\\nof Ammon at Thebes had the labors of the kings of all the dynasties from\\nthe twelfth to the last. Ordinarily in front of the temple a great gate-way is\\nerected, with inclined facesâ€”the pylone. On either side of the entrance is\\nan obelisk, a needle of rock with gilded point, or perhaps a colossus in\\nstone representing a sitting giant.', 'Often the approach to the temple is by a\\nlong avenue rimmed with sphinxes. Pyramids, pylones, colossi, sphinxes, and obelisks characterize this\\narchitecture. Everything is massive, compact, and, above all, immense.', 'Hence these monuments appear clumsy but indestructible. Sculpture. â€”Egyptian sculptors began with imitating nature.', 'The oldest\\nstatues are impressive for their life and freshness, and are doubtless\\nportraits of the dead. Of this sort is the famous squatting scribe of the\\nLouvre. But beginning with the eleventh dynasty the sculptor is no longer\\nfree to represent the human body as he sees it, but must follow\\nconventional rules fixed by religion.', 'And so all the statues resemble one\\nanotherâ€”parallel legs, the feet joined, arms crossed on the breast, the\\nfigure motionless; the statues are often majestic, but always stiff and\\nmonotonous. Art has ceased to reproduce nature and is become a\\nconventional symbol. Painting.', 'â€”The Egyptians used very solid colors; after 5,000 years they are\\nstill fresh and bright. But they were ignorant of coloring designs; they\\nknew neither tints, shadows, nor perspective. Painting, like sculpture, was\\nsubject to religious rules and was therefore monotonous.', 'If fifty persons\\nwere to be represented, the artist made them all alike. Literature. â€”The literature of the Egyptians is found in the tombsâ€”not\\nonly books of medicine, of magic and of piety, but also poems, letters,\\naccounts of travels, and even romances.', 'Destiny of the Egyptian Civilization. â€”The Egyptians conserved their\\ncustoms, religion, and arts even after the fall of their empire. Subjects of the\\nPersians, then the Greeks, and at last of the Romans, they kept their old\\nusages, their hieroglyphics, their mummies and sacred animals.', 'At last\\nbetween the third and second centuries A. D. , Egyptian civilization was\\nslowly extinguished.', 'CHAPTER IV\\nASSYRIANS AND BABYLONIANS\\nCHALDEA\\nThe Land. â€”From the high and snowy mountains of Armenia flow two\\ndeep and rapid rivers, the Tigris to the east, the Euphrates to the west. At\\nfirst in close proximity, they separate as they reach the plain.', 'The Tigris\\nmakes a straight course, the Euphrates a great dÃ©tour towards the sandy\\ndeserts; then they unite before emptying into the sea. The country which\\nthey embrace is Chaldea. It is an immense plain of extraordinarily fertile\\nsoil; rain is rare and the heat is overwhelming.', 'But the streams furnish\\nwater and this clayey soil when irrigated by canals becomes the most fertile\\nin the world. Wheat and barley produce 200-fold; in good years the returns\\nare 300-fold. Palms constitute the forests and from these the people make\\ntheir wine, meal and flour.', 'The People. â€”For many centuries, perhaps as long as Egypt, Chaldea has\\nbeen the abode of civilized peoples. Many races from various lands have\\nmet and mingled in these great plains.', 'There were Turanians of the yellow\\nrace, similar to the Chinese, who came from the north-east; Cushites, deep\\nbrown in color, related to the Egyptians, came from the east; Semites, of the\\nwhite race, of the same stock as the Arabs, descended from the north. The\\nChaldean people had its origin in this mixture of races. The Cities.', 'â€”Chaldean priests related that their kings had ruled for 150,000\\nyears. While this is a fable, they were right in ascribing great antiquity to\\nthe Chaldean empire. The soil of Chaldea is everywhere studded with hills\\nand each of these is a mass of dÃ©bris, the residue of a ruined city.', 'Many of\\nthese have been excavated and many cities brought to view, (Our, Larsam,\\nBal-ilou), and some inscriptions recovered. De Sarsec, a Frenchman, has\\ndiscovered the ruins of an entire city, overwhelmed by the invader and its\\npalace destroyed by fire. These ancient peoples are still little known to us;\\nmany sites remain to be excavated when it is hoped new inscriptions will\\nbe found.', 'Their empire was destroyed about 2,300 B. C. ; it may then have\\nbeen very old.', 'THE ASSYRIANS\\nAssyria. â€”The country back of Chaldea on the Tigris is Assyria. It also is\\nfertile, but cut with hills and rocks.', 'Situated near the mountains, it\\nexperiences snow in winter and severe storms in summer. Origins. â€”Chaldea had for a long time been covered with towns while yet\\nthe Assyrians lived an obscure life in their mountains.', 'About the thirteenth\\ncentury B. C. their kings leading great armies began to invade the plains\\nand founded a mighty empire whose capital was Nineveh.', 'Ancient Accounts. â€”Until about forty years ago we knew almost nothing of\\nthe Assyriansâ€”only a legend recounted by the Greek Diodorus Siculus. Ninus, according to the story, had founded Nineveh and conquered all\\nAsia Minor; his wife, Semiramis, daughter of a goddess, had subjected\\nEgypt, after which she was changed into the form of a dove.', 'Incapable\\nkings had succeeded this royal pair for the space of 1,300 years; the last,\\nSardanapalus, besieged in his capital, was burnt with his wives. This\\nromance has not a word of truth in it. Modern Discoveries.', 'â€”In 1843, Botta, the French consul at Mossoul,\\ndiscovered under a hillock near the Tigris, at Khorsabad, the palace of an\\nAssyrian king. Here for the first time one could view the productions of\\nAssyrian art; the winged bulls cut in stone, placed at the gate of the palace\\nwere found intact and removed to the Louvre Museum in Paris. The\\nexcavations of Botta drew the attention of Europe, so that many\\nexpeditions were sent out, especially by the English; Place and Layard\\ninvestigated other mounds and discovered other palaces.', 'These ruins had\\nbeen well preserved, protected by the dryness of the climate and by a\\ncovering of earth. They found walls adorned with bas-reliefs and paintings;\\nstatues and inscriptions were discovered in great number. It was now\\npossible to study on the ground the plan of the structures and to publish\\nreproductions of the monuments and inscriptions.', 'The palace first discovered, that of Khorsabad, had been built by King\\nSargon at Nineveh, the site of the capital of the Assyrian kings. The city\\nwas built on several eminences, and was encircled by a wall 25 to 30 miles\\nin length, in the form of a quadrilateral. The wall was composed of bricks\\non the exterior and of earth within.', 'The dwellings of the city have\\ndisappeared leaving no traces, but we have recovered many palaces\\nconstructed by various kings of Assyria. Nineveh remained the residence\\nof the kings down to the time that the Assyrian empire was destroyed by\\nthe Medes and Chaldeans. Inscriptions on the Bricks.', 'â€”In these inscriptions every character is formed\\nof a combination of signs shaped like an arrow or wedge, and this is the\\nreason that this style of writing is termed cuneiform (Latin cuneus and\\nforma). To trace these signs the writer used a stylus with a triangular point;\\nhe pressed it into a tablet of soft clay which was afterwards baked to\\nharden it and to make the impression permanent. In the palace of\\nAssurbanipal a complete library of brick tablets has been found in which\\nbrick serves the purpose of paper.', 'Cuneiform Writing. â€”For many years the cuneiform writing has occupied\\nthe labors of many scholars impatient to decipher it. It has been\\nexceedingly difficult to read, for, in the first place, it served as the writing\\nmedium of five different languagesâ€”Assyrian, Susian, Mede, Chaldean,\\nand Armenian, without counting the Old Persianâ€”and there was no\\nknowledge of these five languages.', 'Then, too, it is very complicated, for\\nseveral reasons:\\n1. It is composed at the same time of symbolic signs, each of which\\nrepresents a word (sun, god, fish), and of syllabic signs, each of which\\nrepresents a syllable. 2.', 'There are nearly two hundred syllabic signs, much alike and easy to\\nconfuse. 3. The same sign is often the representation of a word and a syllable.', '4. Often (and this is the hardest condition) the same sign is used to\\nrepresent different syllables. Thus the same sign is sometimes read \"ilou,\"\\nand sometimes \"an.', '\" This writing was difficult even for those who executed\\nit. \"A good half of the cuneiform monuments which we possess comprises\\nguides (grammars, dictionaries, pictures), which enable us to decipher the\\nother half, and which we consult just as Assyrian scholars did 2,500 years\\nago. \"\\nCuneiform inscriptions have been solved in the same manner as the\\nEgyptian hieroglyphicsâ€”there was an inscription in three languagesâ€”\\nAssyrian, Mede, and Persian.', 'The last gave the key to the other two. The Assyrian People. â€”The Assyrians were a race of hunters and soldiers.', 'Their bas-reliefs ordinarily represent them armed with bow and lance,\\noften on horseback. They were good knightsâ€”alert, brave, clever in\\nskirmish and battle; also bombastic, deceitful, and sanguinary. For six\\ncenturies they harassed Asia, issuing from their mountains to hurl\\nthemselves on their neighbors, and returning with entire peoples reduced\\nto slavery.', 'They apparently made war for the mere pleasure of slaying,\\nravaging, and pillaging. No people ever exhibited greater ferocity. The King.', 'â€”Following Asiatic usage they regarded their king as the\\nrepresentative of God on earth and gave him blind obedience. He was\\nabsolute master of all his subjects, he led them in battle, and at their head\\nfought against other peoples of Asia. On his return he recorded his exploits\\non the walls of his palace in a long inscription in which he told of his\\nvictories, the booty which he had taken, the cities burned, the captives\\nbeheaded or flayed alive.', 'We present some passages from these stories of\\ncampaigns:\\nAssurnazir-hapal in 882 says, \"I built a wall before the great gates of the\\ncity; I flayed the chiefs of the revolt and with their skins I covered this wall. Some were immured alive in the masonry, others were crucified or\\nimpaled along the wall. I had some of them flayed in my presence and had\\nthe wall hung with their skins.', 'I arranged their heads like crowns and their\\ntransfixed bodies in the form of garlands. \"\\nIn 745 Tiglath-Pilezer II writes, \"I shut up the king in his royal city. I raised\\nmountains of bodies before his gates.', 'All his villages I destroyed,\\ndesolated, burnt. I made the country desert, I changed it into hills and\\nmounds of dÃ©bris. \"\\nIn the seventh century Sennacherib wrote: \"I passed like a hurricane of\\ndesolation.', 'On the drenched earth the armor and arms swam in the blood\\nof the enemy as in a river. I heaped up the bodies of their soldiers like\\ntrophies and I cut off their extremities. I mutilated those whom I took alive\\nlike blades of straw; as punishment I cut off their hands.', '\" In a bas-relief\\nwhich shows the town of Susa surrendering to Assurbanipal one sees the\\nchiefs of the conquered tortured by the Assyrians; some have their ears cut\\noff, the eyes of others are put out, the beard torn out, while some are flayed\\nalive. Evidently these kings took delight in burnings, massacres, and\\ntortures. Ruin of the Assyrian Empire.', 'â€”The Assyrian rÃ©gime began with the\\ncapture of Babylon (about 1270). From the ninth century the Assyrians,\\nalways at war, subjected or ravaged Babylonia, Syria, Palestine, and even\\nEgypt. The conquered always revolted, and the massacres were repeated.', 'At last the Assyrians were exhausted. The Babylonians and Medes made an\\nalliance and destroyed their empire. In 625 their capital, Nineveh, \"the lair\\nof lions, the bloody city, the city gorged with prey,\" as the Jewish prophets\\ncall it, was taken and destroyed forever.', '\"Nineveh is laid waste,\" says the\\nprophet Nahum, \"who will bemoan her?\"\\nTHE BABYLONIANS\\nThe Second Chaldean Empire. â€”In the place of the fallen Assyrian empire\\nthere arose a new powerâ€”in ancient Chaldea. This has received the name\\nBabylonian Empire or the Second Chaldean Empire.', 'A Jewish prophet\\nmakes one say to Jehovah, \"I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty\\nnation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess\\ndwelling places that are not theirs. Their horses are swifter than leopards. Their horsemen spread themselves; (their horsemen) shall fly as the eagle\\nthat hasteth to eat.', '\" They were a people of knights, martial and victorious,\\nlike the Assyrians. They subjected Susiana, Mesopotamia, Syria, and\\nJordan. But their rÃ©gime was short: founded in 625, the Babylonian Empire\\nwas overthrown by the Persians in 538 B.', 'C. Babylon. â€”The mightiest of its kings, Nebuchadrezzar (or\\nNebuchadnezzar), 604-561, who destroyed Jerusalem and carried the Jews\\ninto captivity, built many temples and places in Babylon, his capital.', 'These\\nmonuments were in crude brick as the plain of the Euphrates has no\\nsupply of stone; in the process of decay they have left only enormous\\nmasses of earth and dÃ©bris. And yet it has been possible on the site of\\nBabylon to recover some inscriptions and to restore the plan of the city. The\\nGreek Herodotus who had visited Babylon in the fifth century B.', 'C. ,\\ndescribes it in detail. The city was surrounded by a square wall cut by the\\nEuphrates; it covered about 185 square miles, or seven times the extent of\\nParis.', 'This immense space was not filled with houses; much of it was\\noccupied with fields to be cultivated for the maintenance of the people in\\nthe event of a siege. Babylon was less a city than a fortified camp. The walls\\nequipped with towers and pierced by a hundred gates of brass were so\\nthick that a chariot might be driven on them.', 'All around the wall was a\\nlarge, deep ditch full of water, with its sides lined with brick. The houses of\\nthe city were constructed of three or four stories. The streets intersected at\\nright angles.', 'The bridge and docks of the Euphrates excited admiration; the\\nfortified palace also, and the hanging gardens, one of the seven wonders of\\nthe world. These gardens were terraces planted with trees, supported by\\npillars and rows of arches. Tower of Babylon.', 'â€”Hard by the city Nebuchadnezzar had aimed to\\nrebuild the town of Babel. \"For the admiration of men,\" he says in an\\ninscription: \"I rebuilt and renovated the wonder of Borsippa, the temple of\\nthe seven spheres of the world. I laid the foundations and built it according\\nto its ancient plan.', '\" This temple, in the form of a square, comprised seven\\nsquare towers raised one above another, each tower being dedicated to one\\nof the seven planets and painted with the color attributed by religion to this\\nplanet. They were, beginning with the lowest: Saturn (black), Venus\\n(white), Jupiter (purple), Mercury (blue), Mars (vermilion), the moon\\n(silver), the sun (gold). The highest tower contained a chapel with a table of\\ngold and magnificent couch whereon a priestess kept watch continually.', 'CUSTOMS AND RELIGION\\nCustoms. â€”We know almost nothing of these peoples apart from the\\ntestimony of their monuments, and nearly all of these refer to the\\nachievements of their kings. The Assyrians are always represented at war,\\nhunting, or in the performance of ceremonies; their women never appear\\non the bas-reliefs; they were confined in a harem and never went into\\npublic life.', 'The Chaldeans on the contrary, were a race of laborers and\\nmerchants, but of their life we know nothing. Herodotus relates that once a\\nyear in their towns they assembled all the girls to give them in marriage;\\nthey sold the prettiest, and the profits of the sale of these became a dower\\nfor the marriage of the plainest. \"According to my view,\" he adds, \"this is\\nthe wisest of all their laws.', '\"\\nReligion. â€”The religion of the Assyrians and Chaldeans was the same, for\\nthe former had adopted that of the latter. It is very obscure to us, since it\\noriginated, like that of the Chaldean people, in a confusion of religions very\\ndifferently mingled.', 'The Turanians, like the present yellow race of Siberia,\\nimagined the world full of demons (plague, fever, phantoms, vampires),\\nengaged in prowling around men to do them harm; sorcerers were invoked\\nto banish these demons by magical formulas. The Cushites adored a pair of\\ngods, the male deity of force and the female of matter. The Chaldean\\npriests, united in a powerful guild, confused the two religions into a single\\none.', 'The Gods. â€”The supreme god at Babylon is Ilou; in Assyria, Assur. No\\ntemple was raised to him.', 'Three gods proceed from him: Anou, the \"lord of\\ndarkness,\" under the figure of a man with the head of a fish and the tail of\\nan eagle; Bel, the \"sovereign of spirits,\" represented as a king on the throne;\\nNouah, the \"master of the visible world,\" under the form of a genius with\\nfour extended wings. Each has a feminine counterpart who symbolizes\\nfruitfulness. Below these gods are the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets,\\nfor in the transparent atmosphere of Chaldea the stars shine with a\\nbrilliancy which is strange to us; they gleam like deities.', 'To these the\\nChaldeans raised temples, veritable observatories in which men who\\nadored them could follow all their motions. Astrology. â€”The priests believed that these stars, being powerful deities,\\nhad determining influence on the lives of men.', \"Every man comes into the\\nworld under the influence of a planet and this moment decides his destiny;\\none may foretell one's fortune if the star under which one is born is known. This is the origin of the horoscope. What occurs in heaven is indicative of\\nwhat will come to pass on earth; a comet, for example, announces a\\nrevolution.\", 'By observing the heavens the Chaldean priests believed they\\ncould predict events. This is the origin of Astrology. Sorcery.', 'â€”The Chaldeans had also magical words; these were uttered to\\nbanish spirits or to cause their appearance. This custom, a relic of the\\nTuranian religion, is the origin of sorcery. From Chaldea astrology and\\nsorcery were diffused over the Roman empire, and later over all Europe.', 'In\\nthe formulas of sorcery of the sixteenth century corrupted Assyrian words\\nmay still be detected. Sciences. â€”On the other hand it is in Chaldea that we have the beginning of\\nastronomy.', 'From this land have come down to us the zodiac, the week of\\nseven days in honor of the seven planets; the division of the year into\\ntwelve months, of the day into twenty-four hours, of the hour into sixty\\nminutes, of the minute into sixty seconds. Here originated, too, the system\\nof weights and measures reckoned on the unit of length, a system adopted\\nby all the ancient peoples. ARTS\\nArchitecture.', 'â€”We do not have direct knowledge of the art of the\\nChaldeans, since their monuments have fallen to ruin. But the Assyrian\\nartists whose works we possess imitated those of Chaldea, and so we may\\nform a judgment at the same time of the two countries. The Assyrians like\\nthe Chaldeans built with crude, sun-dried brick, but they faced the exterior\\nof the wall with stone.', 'Palaces. â€”They constructed their palaces on artificial mounds, making\\nthese low and flat like great terraces. The crude brick was not adapted to\\nbroad and high arches.', 'Halls must therefore be straight and low, but in\\ncompensation they were very long. An Assyrian palace, then, resembled a\\nsuccession of galleries; the roofs were flat terraces provided with\\nbattlements. At the gate stood gigantic winged bulls.', 'Within, the walls\\nwere covered now with panelling in precious woods, now with enamelled\\nbricks, now with plates of sculptural alabaster. Sometimes the chambers\\nwere painted, and even richly encrusted marbles were used. Sculpture.', 'â€”The sculpture of the Assyrian palaces is especially admirable. Statues, truly, are rare and coarse; sculptors preferred to execute bas-reliefs\\nsimilar to pictures on great slabs of alabaster. They represented scenes\\nwhich were often very complicatedâ€”battles, chases, sieges of towns,\\nceremonies in which the king appeared with a great retinue.', 'Every detail is\\nscrupulously done; one sees the files of servants in charge of the feast of the\\nking, the troops of workmen who built his palace, the gardens, the fields,\\nthe ponds, the fish in the water, the birds perched over their nests or\\nflitting from tree to tree. Persons are exhibited in profile, doubtless because\\nthe artist could not depict the face; but they possess dignity and life. Animals often appeared, especially in hunting scenes; they are ordinarily\\nmade with a startling fidelity.', 'The Assyrians observed nature and faithfully\\nreproduced it; hence the merit of their art. The Greeks themselves learned in this school, by imitating the Assyrian\\nbas-reliefs. They have excelled them, but no people, not even the Greeks,\\nhas better known how to represent animals.', 'CHAPTER V\\nTHE ARYANS OF INDIA\\nTHE ARYANS\\nAryan Languages. â€”The races which in our day inhabit Europeâ€”Greeks\\nand Italians to the south, Slavs in Russia, Teutons in Germany, Celts in\\nIrelandâ€”speak very different languages. When, however, one studies these\\nlanguages closely, it is perceived that all possess a stock of common words,\\nor at least certain roots.', 'The same roots occur in Sanscrit, the ancient\\nlanguage of the Hindoos, and also in Zend, the ancient tongue of the\\nPersians. Thus,\\nFatherâ€”pÃ¨re (French), pitar (Sanscrit), pater (Greek and Latin). It is the\\nsame word pronounced in various ways.', 'From this (and other such\\nexamples) it has been concluded that allâ€”Hindoos, Persians, Greeks,\\nLatins, Celts, Germans, Slavsâ€”once spoke the same language, and\\nconsequently were one people. The Aryan People. â€”These peoples then called themselves Aryans and\\nlived to the north-west of India, either in the mountains of Pamir, or in the\\nsteppes of Turkestan or Russia; from this centre they dispersed in all\\ndirections.', 'The majority of the peopleâ€”Greeks, Latins, Germans, Slavsâ€”\\nforgot their origin; but the sacred books of the Hindoos and the Persians\\npreserve the tradition. Effort has been made to reconstruct the life of our\\nAryan ancestors in their mountain home before the dispersion. It was a\\nrace of shepherds; they did not till the soil, but subsisted from their herds\\nof cattle and sheep, though they already had houses and even villages.', 'It was a fighting race; they knew the lance, the javelin, and shield. Government was patriarchal; a man had but one wife; as head of the family\\nhe was for his wife, his children, and his servants at once priest, judge, and\\nking. In all the countries settled by the Aryans they have followed this type\\nof lifeâ€”patriarchal, martial, and pastoral.', 'PRIMITIVE RELIGION OF THE HINDOOS\\nThe Aryans on the Indus. â€”About 2,000 years before our era some Aryan\\ntribes traversed the passes of the Hindu-Kush and swarmed into India. They found the fertile plains of the Indus inhabited by a people of dark\\nskin, with flat heads, industrious and wealthy; they called these aborigines\\nDasyous (the enemy).', 'They made war on them for centuries and ended by\\nexterminating or subjecting them; they then gradually took possession of\\nall the Indus valley (the region of the five rivers). They then called\\nthemselves Hindoos. The Vedas.', 'â€”These people were accustomed in their ceremonies to chant\\nhymns (vedas) in honor of their gods. These chants constituted a vast\\ncompilation which has been preserved to the present time. They were\\ncollected, perhaps, about the fourteenth century B.', 'C. when the Aryans had\\nnot yet passed the Indus. The hymns present to us the oldest religion of the\\nHindoos.', 'The Gods. â€”The Hindoo calls his gods devas (the resplendent). Everything\\nthat shines is a divinityâ€”the heavens, the dawn, the clouds, the starsâ€”but\\nespecially the sun (Indra) and fire (Agni).', 'Indra. â€”The sun, Indra, the mighty one, \"king of the world and master of\\ncreatures,\" bright and warm, traverses the heavens on a car drawn by azure\\nsteeds; he it is who hurls the thunderbolt, sends the rain, and banishes the\\nclouds. India is a country of violent tempests; the Hindoo struck with this\\nphenomenon explained it in his own fashion.', 'He conceived the black cloud\\nas an envelope in which were contained the waters of heaven; these\\nbeneficent waters he called the gleaming cows of Indra. When the storm is\\ngathering, an evil genius, Vritra, a three-headed serpent, has driven away\\nthe cows and enclosed them in the black cavern whence their bellowings\\nare heard (the far-away rumblings of thunder). Indra applies himself to the\\ntask of finding them; he strikes the cavern with his club, the strokes of\\nwhich are heard (the thunderbolt), and the forked tongue of the serpent\\n(the lightning) darts forth.', 'At last the serpent is vanquished, the cave is\\nopened, the waters released fall on the earth, Indra the victor appears in\\nglory. Agni. â€”Fire (Agni, the tireless) is regarded as another form of the sun.', 'The\\nHindoo, who produces it by rapidly rubbing two pieces of wood together,\\nimagines that the fire comes from the wood and that the rain has placed it\\nthere. He conceives it then as the fire of heaven descended to earth; in fact,\\nwhen one places it on the hearth, it springs up as if it would ascend toward\\nheaven. Agni dissipates darkness, warms mankind, and cooks his food; it is\\nthe benefactor and the protector of the house.', 'It is also \"the internal fire,\"\\nthe soul of the world; even the ancestor of the human race is the \"son of\\nlightning. \" Thus, heat and light, sources of all life, are the deities of the\\nHindoo. Worship.', 'â€”To adore his gods he strives to reproduce what he sees in\\nheaven. He ignites a terrestrial fire by rubbing sticks, he nourishes it by\\ndepositing on the hearth, butter, milk, and soma, a fermented drink. To\\ndelight the gods he makes offerings to them of fruits and cakes; he even\\nsacrifices to them cattle, rams and horses; he then invokes them, chanting\\nhymns to their praise.', '\"When thou art bidden by us to quaff the soma,\\ncome with thy sombre steeds, thou deity whose darts are stones. Our\\ncelebrant is seated according to prescription, the sacred green is spread, in\\nthe morning stones have been gathered together. Take thy seat on the holy\\nsward; taste, O hero, our offering to thee.', 'Delight thyself in our libations\\nand our chants, vanquisher of Vritra, thou who art honored in these\\nceremonies of ours, O Indra. \"\\nThe Hindoo thinks that the gods, felicitated by his offerings and homage,\\nwill in their turn make him happy. He says naÃ¯vely, \"Give sacrifice to the\\ngods for their profit, and they will requite you.', 'Just as men traffic by the\\ndiscussion of prices, let us exchange force and vigor, O Indra. Give to me\\nand I will give to you; bring to me and I will bring to you. \"\\nAncestor Worship.', 'â€”At the same time the Hindoo adores his ancestors\\nwho have become gods, and perhaps this cult is the oldest of all. It is the\\nbasis of the family. The father who has transmitted the \"fire of life\" to his\\nchildren makes offering every day at his hearth-fire, which must never be\\nextinguished, the sacrifice to gods and ancestors, and utters the prayers.', 'Here it is seen that among Hindoos, as among other Aryans, the father is at\\nonce a priest and a sovereign. THE BRAHMANIC SOCIETY\\nThe Hindoos on the Ganges. â€”The Hindoos passing beyond the region of\\nthe Indus, between the fourteenth and tenth century B.', 'C. conquered all the\\nimmense plains of the Ganges. Once settled in this fertile country, under a\\nburning climate, in the midst of a people of slaves, they gradually changed\\ncustoms and religion.', 'And so the Brahmanic society was established. Many\\nworks in Sanscrit are preserved from this time, which, with the Vedas,\\nform the sacred literature of the Hindoos. The principal are the great epic\\npoems, the Mahabarata, which has more than 200,000 verses; the\\nRamayana with 50,000, and the laws of Manou, the sacred code of India.', 'Caste. â€”In this new society there were no longer, as in the time of the\\nVedas, poets who chanted hymns to the gods. The men who know the\\nprayers and the ceremonies are become theologians by profession; the\\npeople revere and obey them.', 'The following is their conception of the\\nstructure of society: the supreme god, Brahma, has produced four kinds of\\nmen to each of whom he has assigned a mission. From his mouth he drew\\nthe Brahmans, who are, of course, the theologians; their mission is to study,\\nto teach the hymns, to perform the sacrifices. The Kchatrias have come\\nfrom his arms; these are the warriors who are charged with the protection\\nof the people.', 'The VaÃ¯cyas proceed from the thigh; they must raise cattle,\\ntill the earth, loan money at interest, and engage in commerce. The Soudras\\nissue from his foot; their only mission is to serve all the others. There were already in the Aryan people theologians, warriors, artisans, and\\nbelow them aborigines reduced to slavery.', 'These were classes which one\\ncould enter and from which one could withdraw. But the Brahmans\\ndetermined that every man should be attached to the condition in which he\\nwas born, he and his descendants for all time. The son of a workman could\\nnever become a warrior, nor the son of a warrior a theologian.', 'Thus each is\\nchained to his own state. Society is divided into four hereditary and closed\\ncastes. The Unclean.', 'â€”Whoever is not included in one of the four castes is unclean,\\nexcluded from society and religion. The Brahmans reckoned forty-four\\ngrades of outcasts; the last and the lowest is that of the pariahs; their very\\nname is an insult. The outcasts may not practise any honorable trade nor\\napproach other men.', 'They may possess only dogs and asses, for these are\\nunclean beasts. \"They must have for their clothing the garments of the\\ndead; for plates, broken pots; ornaments of iron; they must be ceaselessly\\non the move from one place to another. \"\\nThe Brahmans.', 'â€”In the organization of society the Brahmans were\\nassigned the first place. \"Men are the first among intelligent beings; the\\nBrahmans are the first among men. They are higher than warriors, than\\nkings, even.', 'As between a Brahman of ten years of age and a Kchatria of\\none hundred years, the Brahman is to be regarded as the father. \" These are\\nnot priests as in Egypt and Chaldea, but only men who know religion, and\\npass their time in reading and meditating on the sacred books; they live\\nfrom presents made to them by other men. To this day they are the\\ndominating class of India.', 'As they marry only among themselves, better\\nthan the other Hindoos they have preserved the Aryan type and have a\\nclearer resemblance to Europeans. The New Religion of Brahma. â€”The Brahmans did not discard the ancient\\ngods of the Vedas, they continued to adore them.', 'But by sheer ingenuity\\nthey invented a new god. When prayers are addressed to the gods, the\\ndeities are made to comply with the demands made on them, as if they\\nthought that prayer was more powerful than the gods. And so prayer\\n(Brahma) has become the highest of all deities.', 'He is invoked with awe:\"O\\ngod, I behold in thy body all the gods and the multitudes of living beings. I\\nam powerless to regard thee in thine entirety, for thou shinest like the fire\\nand the sun in thine immensity. Thou art the Invisible, thou art the\\nsupreme Intelligence, thou art the sovereign treasure of the universe,\\nwithout beginning, middle, or end; equipped with infinite might.', 'Thine\\narms are without limit, thine eyes are like the moon and the sun, thy mouth\\nhath the brightness of the sacred fire. With thyself alone thou fillest all the\\nspace between heaven and earth, and thou permeatest all the universe. \"\\nBrahma is not only supreme god; he is the soul of the universe.', 'All beings\\nare born from Brahma, all issue naturally from him, not as a product comes\\nfrom the hands of an artisan, but \"as the tree from the seed, as the web\\nfrom the spider. \" Brahma is not a deity who has created the world; he is the\\nvery substance of the world. Transmigration of Souls.', 'â€”There is, then, a soul, a part of the soul of\\nBrahma, in every being, in gods, in men, in animals, in the very plants and\\nstones. But these souls pass from one body into another; this is the\\ntransmigration of souls. When a man dies, his soul is tested; if it is good, it\\npasses into the heaven of Indra there to enjoy felicity; if it is bad, it falls into\\none of the twenty-eight hells, where it is devoured by ravens, compelled to\\nswallow burning cakes, and is tormented by demons.', 'But souls do not\\nremain forever in heaven or in the hells; they part from these to begin a\\nnew life in another body. The good soul rises, entering the body of a saint,\\nperhaps that of a god; the evil soul descends, taking its abode in some\\nimpure animalâ€”in a dog, an ass, even in a plant. In this new state it may\\nrise or fall.', 'And this journey from one body to another continues until the\\nsoul by degrees comes to the highest sphere. From lowest to highest in the\\nscale, say the Brahmans, twenty-four millions of years elapse. At last\\nperfect, the soul returns to the level of Brahma from which it descends and\\nis absorbed into it.', 'Character of this Religion. â€”The religion of the Aryans, simple and happy,\\nwas that of a young and vigorous people. This is complicated and barren; it\\ntakes shape among men who are not engaged in practical life; it is\\nenervated by the heat and vexatious of life.', \"Rites. â€”The practice of the religion is much more complicated. Hymns and\\nsacrifices are still offered to the gods, but the Brahmans have gradually\\ninvented thousands of minute customs so that one's life is completely\\nengaged with them.\", 'For all the ceremonies of the religious life there are\\nprayers, offerings, vows, libations, ablutions. Some of the religious\\nrequirements attach themselves to dress, ornaments, etiquette, drinking,\\neating, mode of walking, of lying down, of sleeping, of dressing, of\\nundressing, of bathing. It is ordered: \"That a Brahman shall not step over a\\nrope to which a calf is attached; that he shall not run when it rains; that he\\nshall not drink water in the hollow of his hand; that he shall not scratch his\\nhead with both his hands.', 'The man who breaks clods of earth, who cuts\\ngrass with his nails or who bites his nails is, like the outcast, speedily\\nhurried to his doom. \" An animal must not be killed, for a human soul may\\nperhaps be dwelling in the body; one must not eat it on penalty of being\\ndevoured in another life by the animals which one has eaten. All these rites have a magical virtue; he who observes them all is a saint; he\\nwho neglects any of them is impious and destined to pass into the body of\\nan animal.', \"Purity. â€”The principal duty is keeping one's self pure; for every stain is a\\nsin and opens one to the attack of evil spirits. But the Brahmans are very\\nscrupulous concerning purity: men outside of the castes, many animals, the\\nsoil, even the utensils which one uses are so many impure things; whoever\\ntouches these is polluted and must at once purify himself.\", 'Life is consumed\\nin purifications. Penances. â€”For every defect in the rites, a penance is necessary, often a\\nterrible one.', 'He who involuntarily kills a cow must clothe himself in its\\nskin, and for three months, day and night, follow and tend a herd of cows. Whoever has drunk of arrack must swallow a boiling liquid which burns\\nthe internal organs until death results. The Monks.', 'â€”To escape so many dangers and maintain purity, it is better\\nto leave the world. Often a Brahman when he has attained to a\\nconsiderable age withdraws to the desert, fasts, watches, refrains from\\nspeech, exposes himself naked to the rain, holds himself erect between four\\nfires under the burning sun. After some years, the solitary becomes\\n\"penitent\"; then his only subsistence is from almsgiving; for whole days he\\nlifts an arm in the air uttering not a word, holding his breath; or perchance,\\nhe gashes himself with razor-blades; or he may even keep his thumbs\\nclosed until the nails pierce the hands.', 'By these mortifications he destroys\\npassion, releases himself from this life, and by contemplation rises to\\nBrahma. And yet, this way of salvation is open only to the Brahman; and\\neven he has the right to withdraw to the desert only in old age, after having\\nstudied the Vedas all his life, practised all the rites, and established a\\nfamily. BUDDHISM\\nBuddha.', 'â€”Millions of men who were not Brahmans, suffered by this life of\\nminutiÃ¦ and anguish. A man then appeared who brought a doctrine of\\ndeliverance. He was not a Brahman, but of the caste of the Kchatrias, son of\\na king of the north.', 'To the age of twenty-nine he had lived in the palace of\\nhis father. One day he met an old man with bald head, of wrinkled\\nfeatures, and trembling limbs; a second time he met an incurable invalid,\\ncovered with ulcers, without a home; again he fell in with a decaying\\ncorpse devoured by worms. And so, thought he, youth, health, and life are\\nnothing for they offer no resistance to old age, to sickness, and to death.', 'He\\nhad compassion on men and sought a remedy. Then he met a religious\\nmendicant with grave and dignified air; following his example he decided\\nto renounce the world. These four meetings had determined his calling.', 'Buddha fled to the desert, lived seven years in penitence, undergoing\\nhunger, thirst, and rain. These mortifications gave him no repose. He ate,\\nbecame strong, and found the truth.', 'Then he reÃ«ntered the world to preach\\nit; he made disciples in crowds who called him Buddha (the scholar); and\\nwhen he died after forty-five years of preaching, Buddhism was\\nestablished. Nirvana. â€”To live is to be unhappy, taught Buddha.', 'Every man suffers\\nbecause he desires the goods of this world, youth, health, life, and cannot\\nkeep them. All life is a suffering; all suffering is born of desire. To suppress\\nsuffering, it is necessary to root out desire; to destroy it one must cease\\nfrom wishing to live, \"emancipate one\\'s self from the thirst of being.', '\" The\\nwise man is he who casts aside everything that attaches to this life and\\nmakes it unhappy. One must cease successively from feeling, wishing,\\nthinking. Then, freed from passion, volition, even from reflection, he no\\nlonger suffers, and can, after his death, come to the supreme good, which\\nconsists in being delivered from all life and from all suffering.', 'The aim of\\nthe wise man is the annihilation of personality: the Buddhists call it\\nNirvana. Charity. â€”The Brahmans also considered life as a place of suffering and\\nannihilation as felicity.', 'Buddha came not with a new doctrine, but with\\nnew sentiments. The religion of the Brahmans was egoistic. Buddha had compassion on\\nmen, he loved them, and preached love to his disciples.', 'It was just this\\nword of sympathy of which despairing souls were in need. He bade to love\\neven those who do us ill. Purna, one of his disciples, went forth to preach\\nto the barbarians.', 'Buddha said to him to try him, \"There are cruel,\\npassionate, furious men; if they address angry words to you, what would\\nyou think?\" \"If they addressed angry words to me,\" said Purna, \"I should\\nthink these are good men, these are gentle men, these men who attack me\\nwith wicked words but who strike me neither with the hand nor with\\nstones. \" \"But if they strike you, what would you think?\" \"I should think that\\nthose were good men who did not strike me with their staves or with their\\nswords. \" \"But if they did strike you with staff and sword, what would you\\nthink then?\" \"That those are good men who strike me with staff and sword,\\nbut do not take my life.', '\" \"But if they should take your life?\" \"I should think\\nthem good men who delivered me with so little pain from this body filled\\nas it is with pollution. \" \"Well, well, Purna! You may dwell in the country of\\nthe barbarians. Go, proceed on the way to complete Nirvana and bring\\nothers to the same goal.', '\"\\nFraternity. â€”The Brahmans, proud of their caste, assert that they are purer\\nthan the others. Buddha loves all men equally, he calls all to salvation even\\nthe pariahs, even the barbariansâ€”all he declares are equal.', '\"The Brahman,\"\\nsaid he, \"just like the pariah, is born of woman; why should he be noble\\nand the other vile?\" He receives as disciples street-sweepers, beggars,\\ncripples, girls who sleep on dung-hills, even murderers and thieves; he\\nfears no contamination in touching them. He preaches to them in the street\\nin language simple with parables. Tolerance.', 'â€”The Brahmans passed their lives in the practice of minute rites,\\nregarding as criminal whoever did not observe them. Buddha demanded\\nneither rites nor exertions. To secure salvation it was enough to be\\ncharitable, chaste, and beneficent.', '\"Benevolence,\" says he, \"is the first of\\nvirtues. Doing a little good avails more than the fulfilment of the most\\narduous religious tasks. The perfect man is nothing unless he diffuses\\nhimself in benefits over creatures, unless he comforts the afflicted.', 'My\\ndoctrine is a doctrine of mercy; this is why the fortunate in the world find it\\ndifficult. \"\\nLater History of Buddhism. â€”Thus was established about 500 years before\\nChrist a religion of an entirely new sort.', 'It is a religion without a god and\\nwithout rites; it ordains only that one shall love his neighbor and become\\nbetter; annihilation is offered as supreme recompense. But, for the first time\\nin the history of the world, it preaches self-renunciation, the love of others,\\nequality of mankind, charity and tolerance. The Brahmans made bitter war\\nupon it and extirpated it in India.', 'Missionaries carried it to the barbarians\\nin Ceylon, in Indo-China, Thibet, China, and Japan. It is today the religion\\nof about 500,000,000 people. Changes in Buddhism.', 'â€”During these twenty centuries Buddhism has\\nundergone change. Buddha had himself formed communities of monks. Those who entered these renounced their family, took the vow of poverty\\nand chastity; they had to wear filthy rags and beg their living.', 'These\\nreligious rapidly multiplied; they founded convents in all Eastern Asia,\\ngathered in councils to fix the doctrine, proclaimed dogmas and rules. As\\nthey became powerful they, like the Brahmans, came to esteem themselves\\nas above the rest of the faithful. \"The layman,\" they said, \"plight to support\\nthe religious and consider himself much honored that the holy man accepts\\nhis offering.', 'It is more commendable to feed one religious than many\\nthousands of laymen. \" In Thibet the religious, men and women together,\\nconstitute a fifth of the entire population, and their head, the Grand Lama,\\nis venerated as an incarnation of God. At the same time that they transformed themselves into masters, the\\nBuddhist religious constructed a complicated theology, full of fantastic\\nfigures.', 'They say there is an infinite number of worlds. If one surrounded\\nwith a wall a space capable of holding 100,000 times ten millions of those\\nworlds, if this wall were raised to heaven, and if the whole space were\\nfilled with grains of mustard, the number of the grains would not even\\nthen equal one-half the number of worlds which occupy but one division of\\nheaven. All these worlds are full of creatures, gods, men, beasts, demons,\\nwho are born and who die.', 'The universe itself is annihilated and another\\ntakes its place. The duration of each universe is called kalpa; and this is the\\nway we obtain an impression of a kalpa: if there were a rock twelve miles\\nin height, breadth, and length, and if once in a century it were only touched\\nwith a piece of the finest linen, this rock would be worn and reduced to the\\nsize of a kernel of mango before a quarter of a kalpa had elapsed. Buddha Transformed into a God.', 'â€”It no longer satisfied the Buddhists to\\nhonor their founder as a perfect man; they made him a god, erecting idols\\nto him, and offering him worship. They adored also the saints, his\\ndisciples; pyramids and shrines were built to preserve their bones, their\\nteeth, their cloaks. From every quarter the faithful came to venerate the\\nimpression of the foot of Buddha.', 'Mechanical Prayer. â€”Modern Buddhists regard prayer as a magical\\nformula which acts of itself. They spend the day reciting prayers as they\\nwalk or eat, often in a language which they do not understand.', 'They have\\ninvented prayer-machines; these are revolving cylinders and around these\\nare pasted papers on which the prayer is written; every turn of the cylinder\\ncounts for the utterance of the prayer as many times as it is written on the\\npapers. Amelioration of Manners. â€”And yet Buddhism remains a religion of peace\\nand charity.', 'Wherever it reigns, kings refrain from war, and even from the\\nchase; they establish hospitals, caravansaries, even asylums for animals. Strangers, even Christian missionaries, are hospitably received; they permit\\nthe women to go out, and to walk without veiling themselves; they neither\\nfight nor quarrel. At Bangkok, a city of 400,000 souls, hardly more than one\\nmurder a year is known.', 'Buddhism has enfeebled the intelligence and sweetened the character. CHAPTER VI\\nTHE PERSIANS\\nTHE RELIGION OF ZOROASTER\\nIran. â€”Between the Tigris and the Indus, the Caspian Sea and the Persian\\nGulf rises the land of Iran, five times as great as France, but partly sterile.', 'It\\nis composed of deserts of burning sand and of icy plateaux cut by deep and\\nwooded valleys. Mountains surround it preventing the escape of the rivers\\nwhich must lose themselves in the sands or in the salt lakes. The climate is\\nharsh, very uneven, torrid in summer, frigid in winter; in certain quarters\\none passes from 104Â° above zero to 40Â° below, from the cold of Siberia to\\nthe heat of Senegal.', 'Violent winds blow which \"cut like a sword. \" But in the\\nvalleys along the rivers the soil is fertile. Here the peach and cherry are\\nindigenous; the country is a land of fruits and pastures.', 'The Iranians. â€”Aryan tribes inhabited Iran. Like all the Aryans, they were a\\nrace of shepherds, but well armed and warlike.', 'The Iranians fought on\\nhorseback, drew the bow, and, to protect themselves from the biting wind\\nof their country, wore garments of skin sewed on the body. Zoroaster. â€”Like the ancient Aryans, they first adored the forces of nature,\\nespecially the sun (Mithra).', 'Between the tenth and seventhcenturies before\\nour era their religion was reformed by a sage, Zarathustra (Zoroaster). We\\nknow nothing certainly about him except his name. The Zend-Avesta.', 'â€”No writing from the hand of Zoroaster is preserved to\\nus; but his doctrine, reduced to writing long after his death, is conserved in\\nthe Zend-Avesta (law and reform), the sacred books of the Persians. It was\\na compilation written in an ancient language (the Zend) which the faithful\\nthemselves no longer understood. It was divided into twenty-one books,\\ninscribed on 12,000 cow skins, bound by golden cords.', 'The Mohammedans\\ndestroyed it when they invaded Persia. But some Persian families, faithful\\nto the teaching of Zoroaster, fled into India. Their posterity, whom we call\\nParsees, have there maintained the old religion.', 'An entire book of the\\nZend-Avesta and fragments of two others have been found among them. Ormuzd and Ahriman. â€”The Zend-Avesta is the sacred book of the\\nreligion of Zoroaster.', 'According to these writings Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd),\\n\"the omniscient sovereign,\" created the world. He is addressed in prayer in\\nthe following language: \"I invoke and celebrate the creator, Ahura Mazda,\\nluminous, glorious, most intelligent and beautiful, eminent in purity, who\\npossessest the good knowledge, source of joy, who hast treated us, hast\\nfashioned us, and hast nourished us. \" Since he is perfect in his goodness, he\\ncan create only that which is good.', 'Everything bad in the world has been\\ncreated by an evil deity, Angra Manyou, (Ahriman), the \"spirit of anguish. \"\\nAngels and Demons. â€”Over against Ormuzd, the god and the creator, is\\nAhriman, wicked and destructive.', 'Each has in his service a legion of spirits. The soldiers of Ormuzd are the good angels (yazatas), those of Ahriman\\nthe evil demons (devs). The angels dwell in the East in the light of the\\nrising sun; the demons in the West in the shadows of the darkness.', 'The two\\narmies wage incessant warfare; the world is their battleground, for both\\ntroops are omnipresent. Ormuzd and his angels seek to benefit men, to\\nmake them good and happy; Ahriman and his demons gnaw around them\\nto destroy them, to make them unhappy and wicked. Creatures of Ormuzd and Ahriman.', 'â€”Everything good on the earth is the\\nwork of Ormuzd and works for good; the sun and fire that dispel the night,\\nthe stars, fermented drinks that seem to be liquid fire, the water that\\nsatisfies the thirst of man, the cultivated fields that feed him, the trees that\\nshade him, domestic animalsâ€”especially the dog, the birds (because they\\nlive in the air), among all these the cock since he announces the day. On the\\nother hand everything that is baneful comes from Ahriman and tends to\\nevil: the night, drought, cold, the desert, poisonous plants, thorns, beasts of\\nprey, serpents, parasites (mosquitoes, fleas, bugs) and animals that live in\\ndark holesâ€”lizards, scorpions, toads, rats, ants. Likewise in the moral\\nworld life, purity, truth, work are good things and come from Ormuzd;\\ndeath, filth, falsehood, idleness are bad, and issue from Ahriman.', 'Worship. â€”From these notions proceed worship and morality. Man ought\\nto adore the good god and fight for him.', 'According to Herodotus, \"The\\nPersians are not accustomed to erect statues, temples, or altars to their\\ngods; they esteem those who do this as lacking in sense for they do not\\nbelieve, as the Greeks do, that the gods have human forms. \" Ormuzd\\nmanifests himself only under the form of fire or the sun. This is why the\\nPersians perform their worship in the open air on the mountains, before a\\nlighted fire.', \"To worship Ormuzd they sing hymns to his praise and\\nsacrifice animals in his honor. Morality. â€”Man fights for Ormuzd in aiding his efforts and in overcoming\\nAhriman's.\", 'He wars against darkness in supplying the fire with dry wood\\nand perfumes; against the desert in tilling the soil and in building houses;\\nagainst the animals of Ahriman in killing serpents, lizards, parasites, and\\nbeasts of prey. He battles against impurity in keeping himself clean, in\\nbanishing from himself everything that is dead, especially the nails and\\nhair, for \"where hairs and clipped nails are, demons and unclean animals\\nassemble. \" He fights against falsehood by always being truthful.', '\"The\\nPersians,\" says Herodotus, \"consider nothing so shameful as lying, and\\nafter falsehood nothing so shameful as contracting debts, for he who has\\ndebts necessarily lies. \" He wars against death by marrying and having\\nmany children. \"Terrible,\" says the Zend-Avesta, \"are the houses void of\\nposterity.', '\"\\nFunerals. â€”As soon as a man is dead his body belongs to the evil spirit. It is\\nnecessary, then, to remove it from the house.', 'But it ought not to be burned,\\nfor in this way the fire would be polluted; it should not be buried, for so is\\nthe soil defiled; nor is it to be drowned, and thus contaminate the water. These dispositions of the corpse would bring permanent pollution. The\\nPersians resorted to a different method.', 'The body with face toward the sun\\nwas exposed in an elevated place and left uncovered, securely fixed with\\nstones; the bearers then withdrew to escape the demons, for they assemble\\n\"in the places of sepulture, where reside sickness, fever, filth, cold, and\\ngray hairs. \" Dogs and birds, pure animals, then come to purify the body by\\ndevouring it. Destiny of the Soul.', 'â€”The soul of the dead separates itself from the body. In\\nthe third night after death it is conducted over the \"Bridge of Assembling\"\\n(Schinvat) which leads to the paradise above the gulf of inferno. There\\nOrmuzd questions it on its past life.', 'If it has practised the good, the pure\\nspirits and the spirits of dogs support it and aid it in crossing the bridge\\nand give it entrance into the abode of the blest; the demons flee, for they\\ncannot bear the odor of virtuous spirits. The soul of the wicked, on the\\nother hand, comes to the dread bridge, and reeling, with no one to support\\nit, is dragged by demons to hell, is seized by the evil spirit and chained in\\nthe abyss of darkness. Character of Mazdeism.', 'â€”This religion originated in a country of violent\\ncontrasts, luxuriant valleys side by side with barren steppes, cool oases\\nwith burning deserts, cultivated fields and stretches of sand, where the\\nforces of nature seem engaged in an eternal warfare. This combat which the\\nIranian saw around him he assumed to be the law of the universe. Thus a\\nreligion of great purity was developed, which urged man to work and to\\nvirtue; but at the same time issued a belief in the devil and in demons\\nwhich was to propagate itself in the west and torment all the peoples of\\nEurope.', 'THE PERSIAN EMPIRE\\nThe Medes. â€”Many were the tribes dwelling in Iran; two of these have\\nbecome noted in historyâ€”the Medes and the Persians. The Medes at the\\nwest, nearer the Assyrians, destroyed Nineveh and its empire (625).', 'But\\nsoon they softened their manners, taking the flowing robes, the indolent\\nlife, the superstitious religion of the degenerate Assyrians. They at last\\nwere confused with them. The Persians.', 'â€”The Persians to the east preserved their manners, their\\nreligion, and their vigor. \"For twenty years,\" says Herodotus, \"the Persians\\nteach their children but three thingsâ€”to mount a horse, to draw the bow,\\nand to tell the truth. \"\\nCyrus.', 'â€”About 550 Cyrus, their chief, overthrew the king of the Medes,\\nreunited all the peoples of Iran, and then conquered Lydia, Babylon, and\\nall Asia Minor. Herodotus recounts in detail a legend which became\\nattached to this prince. Cyrus himself in an inscription says of himself, \"I\\nam Cyrus, king of the legions, great king, mighty king, king of Babylon,\\nking of Sumir and Akkad, king of the four regions, son of Cambyses, great\\nking of Susiana, grand-son of Cyrus, king of Susiana.', '\"\\nThe Inscription of Behistun. â€”The eldest son of Cyrus, Cambyses, put to\\ndeath his brother Smerdis and conquered Egypt. What occurred afterward\\nis known to us from an inscription.', 'Today one may see on the frontier of\\nPersia, in the midst of a plain, an enormous rock, cut perpendicularly,\\nabout 1,500 feet high, the rock of Behistun. A bas-relief carved on the rock\\nrepresents a crowned king, with left hand on a bow; he tramples on one\\ncaptive while nine other prisoners are presented before him in chains. An\\ninscription in three languages relates the life of the king: \"Darius the king\\ndeclares, This is what I did before I became king.', 'Cambyses, son of Cyrus,\\nof our race, reigned here before me. This Cambyses had a brother Smerdis,\\nof the same father and the same mother. One day Cambyses killed Smerdis.', 'When Cambyses had killed Smerdis the people were ignorant that Smerdis\\nwas dead. After this Cambyses made an expedition to Egypt and while he\\nwas there the people became rebellious; falsehood was then rife in the\\ncountry, in Persia, in Media and the other provinces. There was at that time\\na magus named Gaumata; he deceived the people by saying that he was\\nSmerdis, the son of Cyrus.', 'Then the whole people rose in revolt, forsook\\nCambyses and went over to the pretender. After this Cambyses died from a\\nwound inflicted by himself. \"After Gaumata had drawn away Persia, Media, and the other countries\\nfrom Cambyses, he followed out his purpose: he became king.', 'The people\\nfeared him on account of his cruelty: he would have killed the people so\\nthat no one might learn that he was not Smerdis, the son of Cyrus. Darius\\nthe king declares there was not a man in all Persia or in Media who dared\\nto snatch the crown from this Gaumata, the magus. Then I presented\\nmyself, I prayed Ormuzd.', 'Ormuzd accorded me his protection. Accompanied by faithful men I killed this Gaumata and his principal\\naccomplices. By the will of Ormuzd I became king.', 'The empire which had\\nbeen stolen from our race I restored to it. The altars that Gaumata, the\\nmagus, had thrown down I rebuilt to the deliverance of the people; I\\nreceived the chants and the sacred ceremonials. \" Having overturned the\\nusurper, Darius had to make war on many of the revolting princes, \"I\\nhave,\" said he, \"won nineteen battles and overcome nine kings.', '\"\\nThe Persian Empire. â€”Darius then subjected the peoples in revolt and\\nreÃ«stablished the empire of the Persians. He enlarged it also by conquering\\nThrace and a province of India.', 'This empire reunited all the peoples of the\\nOrient: Medes and Persians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Jews, PhÅ“nicians,\\nSyrians, Lydians, Egyptians, Indians; it covered all the lands from the\\nDanube on the west to the Indus on the east, from the Caspian Sea on the\\nnorth to the cataracts of the Nile on the south. It was the greatest empire up\\nto this time. One tribe of mountaineers, the last to come, thus received the\\nheritage of all the empires of Asia.', 'The Satrapies. â€”Oriental kings seldom concerned themselves with their\\nsubjects more than to draw money from them, levy soldiers, and collect\\npresents; they never interfered in their local affairs. Darius, like the rest, left\\neach of the peoples of his empire to administer itself according to its own\\ntaste, to keep its language, its religion, its laws, often its ancient princes.', 'But he took care to regulate the taxes which his subjects paid him. He\\ndivided all the empire into twenty districts called satrapies. There were in\\nthe same satrapy peoples who differed much in language, customs, and\\nbeliefs; but each satrapy was to pay a fixed annual tribute, partly in gold\\nand silver, partly in natural products (wheat, horses, ivory).', 'The satrap, or\\ngovernor, had the tribute collected and sent it to the king. Revenues of the Empire. â€”The total revenue of the king amounted to\\nsixteen millions of dollars and this money was paid by weight.', 'This sum\\nwas in addition to the tributes in kind. These sixteen millions of dollars, if\\nwe estimate them by the value of the metals at this time, would be\\nequivalent to one hundred and twenty millions in our day. With this sum\\nthe king supported his satraps, his army, his domestic servants and an\\nextravagant court; there still remained to him every year enormous ingots\\nof metal which accumulated in his treasuries.', 'The king of Persia, like all the\\nOrientals, exercised his vanity in possessing an immense treasure. The Great King. â€”No king had ever been so powerful and rich.', 'The Greeks\\ncalled the Persian king The Great King. Like all the monarchs of the East,\\nthe king had absolute sway over all his subjects, over the Persians as well\\nas over tributary peoples. From Herodotus one can see how Cambyses\\ntreated the great lords at his court.', '\"What do the Persians think of me?\"\\nsaid he one day to Prexaspes, whose son was his cupbearer. \"Master, they\\nload you with praises, but they believe that you have a little too strong\\ndesire for wine. \" \"Learn,\" said Cambyses in anger, \"whether the Persians\\nspeak the truth.', 'If I strike in the middle of the heart of your son who is\\nstanding in the vestibule, that will show that the Persians do not know\\nwhat they say. \" He drew his bow and struck the son of Prexaspes. The\\nyouth fell; Cambyses had the body opened to see where the shot had taken\\neffect The arrow was found in the middle of the heart.', 'The prince, full of\\njoy said in derision to the father of the young man, \"You see that it is the\\nPersians who are out of their senses; tell me if you have seen anybody\\nstrike the mark with so great accuracy. \" \"Master,\" replied Prexaspes, \"I do\\nnot believe that even a god could shoot so surely. \"\\nServices Rendered by the Persians.', 'â€”The peoples of Asia have always paid\\ntribute to conquerors and given allegiance to despots. The Persians, at least,\\nrendered them a great service: in subjecting all these peoples to one master\\nthey prevented them from fighting among themselves. Under their\\ndomination we do not see a ceaseless burning of cities, devastation of\\nfields, massacre or wholesale enslavement of inhabitants.', 'It was a period of\\npeace. Susa and Persepolis. â€”The kings of the Medes and Persians, following the\\nexample of the lords of Assyria, had palaces built for them.', 'Those best\\nknown to us are the palaces at Susa and Persepolis. The ruins of Susa have\\nbeen excavated by a French engineer, who has discovered sculptures,\\ncapitals, and friezes in enameled bricks which give evidence of an\\nadvanced stage of art. The palace of Persepolis has left ruins of\\nconsiderable mass.', 'The rock of the hill had been fashioned into an\\nenormous platform on which the palace was built. The approach to it was\\nby a gently rising staircase so broad that ten horsemen could ascend riding\\nside by side. Persian Architecture.', 'â€”Persian architects had copied the palaces of the\\nAssyrians. At Persepolis and Susa, as in Assyria, are flat-roofed edifices\\nwith terraces, gates guarded by monsters carved in stone, bas-reliefs and\\nenameled bricks, representing hunting-scenes and ceremonies. At three\\npoints, however, the Persians improved on their models:\\n(1) They used marble instead of brick; (2) they made in the halls painted\\nfloors of wood; (3) they erected eight columns in the form of trunks of\\ntrees, the slenderest that we know, twelve times as high as they were thick.', 'Thus their architecture is more elegant and lighter than that of Assyria. The Persians had made little progress in the arts. But they seem to have\\nbeen the most honest, the sanest, and the bravest people of the time.', 'For\\ntwo centuries they exercised in Asia a sovereignty the least cruel and the\\nleast unjust that it had ever known. CHAPTER VII\\nTHE PHÅ’NICIANS\\nTHE PHÅ’NICIAN PEOPLE\\nThe Land. â€”PhÅ“nicia is the narrow strip of country one hundred and fifty\\nmiles long by twenty-four to thirty wide, shut in between the sea of Syria\\nand the high range of Lebanon.', 'It is a succession of narrow valleys and\\nravines confined by abrupt hills which descend towards the sea; little\\ntorrents formed by the snows or rain-storms course through these in the\\nearly spring; in summer no water remains except in wells and cisterns. The\\nmountains in this quarter were always covered with trees; at the summit\\nwere the renowned cedars of Lebanon, on the ridges, pines and cypresses;\\nwhile lower yet palms grew even to the sea-shore. In the valleys flourished\\nthe olive, the vine, the fig, and the pomegranate.', 'The Cities. â€”At intervals along the rocky coast promontories or islands\\nformed natural harbors. On these the PhÅ“nicians had founded their cities;\\nTyre and Arad were each built on a small island.', 'The people housed\\nthemselves in dwellings six to eight stories in height. Fresh water was\\nferried over in ships. The other cities, Gebel, Beirut, and Sidon arose on the\\nmainland.', 'The soil was inadequate to support these swarms of men, and so\\nthe PhÅ“nicians were before all else seamen and traders. PhÅ“nician Ruins. â€”Not a book of the PhÅ“nicians has come down to us, not\\neven their sacred book.', 'The sites of their cities have been excavated. But, in\\nthe words of the scholar sent to do this work, \"Ruins are not preserved,\\nespecially in countries where people are not occupied with them,\" and the\\nSyrians are not much occupied with ruins. They have violated the tombs to\\nremove the jewels of the dead, have demolished edifices to secure stone for\\nbuilding purposes, and Mussulman hatred of chiseled figures has shattered\\nthe sculptures.', 'Very little is found beyond broken marble, cisterns, winepresses cut in the rock and some sarcophagi hewn in rock. All this dÃ©bris\\ngives us little information and we know very little more of the PhÅ“nicians\\nthan Greek writers and Jewish prophets have taught us. Political Organization of the PhÅ“nicians.', 'â€”The PhÅ“nicians never built an\\nempire. Each city had its little independent territory, its assemblies, its\\nking, and its government. For general state business each city sent\\ndelegates to Tyre, which from the thirteenth century B.', 'C. was the principal\\ncity of PhÅ“nicia. The PhÅ“nicians were not a military people, and so\\nsubmitted themselves to all the conquerorsâ€”Egyptians, Assyrians,\\nBabylonians, Persians.', 'They fulfilled all their obligations to them in paying\\ntribute. Tyre. â€”From the thirteenth century Tyre was the most notable of the cities.', 'Its island becoming too small to contain it, a new city was built on the coast\\nopposite. Tyrian merchants had founded colonies in every part of the\\nMediterranean, receiving silver from the mines of Spain and commodities\\nfrom the entire ancient world. The prophet Isaiah calls these traders\\nprinces; Ezekiel describes the caravans which came to them from all\\nquarters.', 'It is Hiram, a king of Tyre, from whom Solomon asked workmen\\nto build his palace and temple at Jerusalem. Carthage. â€”A colony of Tyre surpassed even her in power.', \"In the ninth\\ncentury some Tyrians, exiled by a revolution, founded on the shore of\\nAfrica near Tunis the city of Carthage. A woman led them, Elissar, whom\\nwe call Dido (the fugitive). The inhabitants of the country, says the legend,\\nwere willing to sell her only as much land as could be covered by a bull's\\nhide; but she cut the hide in strips so narrow that it enclosed a wide\\nterritory; and there she constructed a citadel.\", 'Situated at the centre of the\\nMediterranean, provided with two harbors, Carthage flourished, sent out\\ncolonies in turn, made conquests, and at last came to reign over all the\\ncoasts of Africa, Spain, and Sardinia. Everywhere she had agencies for her\\ncommerce and subjects who paid her tribute. The Carthaginian Army.', 'â€”To protect her colonies from the natives, to hold\\nher subjects in check who were always ready to revolt, a strong army was\\nnecessary. But the life of a Carthaginian was too valuable to risk it without\\nnecessity. Carthage preferred to pay mercenary soldiers, recruiting them\\namong the barbarians of her empire and among the adventurers of all\\ncountries.', 'Her army was a bizarre aggregation in which all languages were\\nspoken, all religions practised, and in which every soldier wore different\\narms and costume. There were seen Numidians clothed in lion skins which\\nserved them as couch, mounted bareback on small fleet horses, and\\ndrawing the bow with horse at full gallop; Libyans with black skins, armed\\nwith pikes; Iberians from Spain in white garments adorned with red,\\narmed with a long pointed sword; Gauls, naked to the girdle, bearing\\nenormous shields and a rounded sword which they held in both hands;\\nnatives of the Balearic Islands, trained from infancy to sling with stones or\\nballs of lead. The generals were Carthaginians; the government distrusted\\nthem, watched them closely, and when they were defeated, had them\\ncrucified.', 'The Carthaginians. â€”Carthage had two kings, but the senate was the real\\npower, being composed of the richest merchants of the city. And so every\\nstate question for this government became a matter of commerce.', 'The\\nCarthaginians were hated by all other peoples, who found them cruel,\\ngreedy, and faithless. And yet, since they had a good fleet, had money to\\npurchase soldiers, and possessed an energetic government, they succeeded\\nin the midst of barbarous and divided peoples in maintaining their empire\\nover the western Mediterranean for 300 years (from the sixth to the third\\ncentury B. C.', '). The PhÅ“nician Religion. â€”The PhÅ“nicians and the Carthaginians had a\\nreligion similar to that of the Chaldeans.', 'The male god, Baal, is a sun-god;\\nfor the sun and the moon are in the eyes of the PhÅ“nicians the great forces\\nwhich create and which destroy. Each of the cities of PhÅ“nicia has\\ntherefore its divine pair: at Sidon it is Baal Sidon (the sun) and Astoreth\\n(the moon); at Gebel, Baal Tammouz and Baaleth; at Carthage, BaalHamon, and Tanith. But the same god changes his name according as he is\\nconceived as creator or destroyer; thus Baal as destroyer is worshipped at\\nCarthage under the name of Moloch.', 'These gods, represented by idols,\\nhave their temples, altars, and priests. As creators they are honored with\\norgies, with tumultuous feasts; as destroyers, by human victims. Astoreth,\\nthe great goddess of Sidon, whom they represented by the crescent of the\\nmoon and the dove, had her cult in the sacred woods.', 'Baal Moloch is\\nfigured at Carthage as a bronze colossus with arms extended and lowered. When they wished to appease him they laid children in his hands who fell\\nat once into a pit of fire. During the siege of Carthage by Agathocles the\\nprincipal men of the city sacrificed to Moloch as many as two hundred of\\ntheir children.', 'This sensual and sanguinary religion inspired other peoples with horror,\\nbut they imitated it. The Jews sacrificed to Baal on the mountains; the\\nGreeks adored Astarte of Sidon under the name of Aphrodite, and Baal\\nMelkhart of Tyre under the name of Herakles. PHÅ’NICIAN COMMERCE\\nPhÅ“nicians Occupations.', 'â€”Crowded into a small territory, the PhÅ“nicians\\ngained their livelihood mainly from commerce. None of the other peoples\\nof the Eastâ€”the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, nor the barbarian\\ntribes of the West (Spaniards, Gauls, Italians) had a navy. The PhÅ“nicians\\nalone in this time dared to navigate.', 'They were the commission merchants\\nof the old world; they went to every people to buy their merchandise and\\nsold them in exchange the commodities of other countries. This traffic was\\nby caravan with the East, by sea with the West. Caravans.', 'â€”On land the PhÅ“nicians sent caravans in three directions:\\n1. â€”Towards Arabia, from which they brought gold, agate, and onyx,\\nincense and myrrh, and the perfumes of Arabia; pearls, spices, ivory,\\nebony, ostrich plumes and apes from India. 2.', 'â€”Towards Assyria, whence came cotton and linen cloths, asphalt,\\nprecious stones, perfumery, and silk from China. 3. â€”Towards the Black Sea, where they went to receive horses, slaves, and\\ncopper vases made by the mountaineers of the Caucasus.', 'Marine Commerce. â€”For their sea commerce they built ships from the\\ncedars of Lebanon to be propelled by oars and sails. In their sailing it was\\nnot necessary to remain always in sight of the coast, for they knew how to\\ndirect their course by the polar star.', 'Bold mariners, they pushed in their\\nlittle boats to the mouth of the Mediterranean; they ventured even to pass\\nthrough the strait of Gibraltar or, as the ancients called it, the Pillars of\\nHercules, and took the ocean course to the shores of England, and perhaps\\nto Norway, PhÅ“nicians in the service of a king of Egypt started in the\\nseventh century B. C. to circumnavigate Africa, and returned, it is said, at\\nthe end of three years by the Red Sea.', 'An expedition issuing from Carthage\\nskirted the coast of Africa to the Gulf of Guinea; the commander Hanno\\nwrote an account of the voyage which is still preserved. Commodities. â€”To civilized peoples the PhÅ“nicians sold the products of\\ntheir industry.', 'In barbarous countries they went to search for what they\\ncould not find in the Orient. On the coast of Greece they gathered shell-fish\\nfrom which they extracted a red tint, the purple; cloths colored with purple\\nwere used among all the peoples of ancient times for garments of kings and\\ngreat lords. From Spain and Sardinia they brought the silver which the inhabitants took\\nfrom the mines.', 'Tin was necessary to make bronze, an alloy of copper and\\ntin, but the Orient did not furnish this, and so they sought it even on the\\ncoasts of England, in the Isles of Tin (the Cassiterides). In every country\\nthey procured slaves. Sometimes they bought them, as lately the slavers\\nbought negroes on the coast of Africa, for all the peoples of this time made\\ncommerce in slaves; sometimes they swooped down on a coast, threw\\nthemselves on the women and children and carried them off to be retained\\nin their own cities or to be sold abroad; for on occasion they were pirates\\nand did not scruple to plunder strangers.', 'The Secrets Kept by the PhÅ“nicians. â€”The PhÅ“nicians did not care to have\\nmariners of other peoples come into competition with them. On the return\\nfrom these far countries they concealed the road which they had travelled.', 'No one in antiquity knew where were the famous Isles of the Cassiterides\\nfrom which they got their tin. It was by chance that a Greek ship\\ndiscovered Spain, with which the PhÅ“nicians had traded for centuries. Carthage drowned the foreign merchants whom they found in Sardinia or\\non the shore of Gibraltar.', 'Once a Carthaginian merchantman, seeing a\\nstrange ship following it, was run aground by the pilot that the foreigner\\nmight not see where he was going. Colonies. â€”In the countries where they traded, the PhÅ“nicians founded\\nfactories, or branch-houses.', 'They were fortified posts on a natural harbor. There they landed their merchandise, ordinarily cloths, pottery, ornaments,\\nand idols. The natives brought down their commodities and an exchange\\nwas made, just as now European merchants do with the negroes of Africa.', 'There were PhÅ“nician markets in Cyprus, in Egypt, and in all the then\\nbarbarous countries of the Mediterraneanâ€”in Crete, Greece, Sicily, Africa,\\nMalta, Sardinia, on the coasts of Spain at Malaga and Cadiz, and perhaps in\\nGaul at Monaco. Often around these PhÅ“nician buildings the natives set\\nup their cabins and the mart became a city. The inhabitants adopted the\\nPhÅ“nician gods, and even after the city had become Greek, the cult of the\\ndove-goddess was found there (as in Cythera), that of the god Melkhart (as\\nat Corinth), or of the god with the bull-face that devours human victims (as\\nin Crete).', 'Influence of the PhÅ“nicians. â€”It is certain that the PhÅ“nicians in founding\\ntheir trading stations cared only for their own interest. But it came to pass\\nthat their colonies contributed to civilization.', 'The barbarians of the West\\nreceived the cloths, the jewels, the utensils of the peoples of the East who\\nwere more civilized, and, receiving them, learned to imitate them. For a\\nlong time the Greeks had only vases, jewels, and idols brought by the\\nPhÅ“nicians, and these served them as models. The PhÅ“nicians brought\\nsimultaneously from Egypt and from Assyria industry and commodities.', 'The Alphabet. â€”At the same time they exported their alphabet. The\\nPhÅ“nicians did not invent writing.', 'The Egyptians knew how to write\\nmany centuries before them, they even made use of letters each of which\\nexpressed its own sound, as in our alphabet. But their alphabet was still\\nencumbered with ancient signs which represented, some a syllable, others\\nan entire word. Doubtless the PhÅ“nicians had need of a simpler system for\\ntheir books of commerce.', 'They rejected all the syllabic signs and\\nideographs, preserving only twenty-two letters, each of which marks a\\nsound (or rather an articulation of the language). The other peoples\\nimitated this alphabet of twenty-two letters. Some, like the Jews, wrote\\nfrom right to left just as the PhÅ“nicians themselves did; others, like the\\nGreeks, from left to right.', 'All have slightly changed the form of the letters,\\nbut the PhÅ“nician alphabet is found at the basis of all the alphabetsâ€”\\nHebrew, Lycian, Greek, Italian, Etruscan, Iberian, perhaps even in the\\nrunes of the Norse. It is the PhÅ“nicians that taught the world how to write. CHAPTER VIII\\nTHE HEBREWS\\nORIGIN OF THE HEBREW PEOPLE\\nThe Bible.', 'â€”The Jews united all their sacred books into a single aggregation\\nwhich we call by a Greek name the Bible, that is to say, the Book. It is the\\nBook par excellence. The sacred book of the Jews became also the sacred\\nbook of the Christians.', 'The Bible is at the same time the history of the\\nJewish nation, and all that we know of the sacred people we owe to the\\nsacred books. The Hebrews. â€”When the Semites had descended from the mountains of\\nArmenia into the plains of the Euphrates, one of their tribes, at the time of\\nthe first Chaldean empire, withdrew to the west, crossed the Euphrates, the\\ndesert, and Syria and came to the country of the Jordan beyond PhÅ“nicia.', 'This tribe was called the Hebrews, that is to say, the people from beyond\\nthe river. Like the majority of the Semites they were a race of nomadic\\nshepherds. They did not till the soil and had no houses; they moved from\\nplace to place with their herds of cattle, sheep, and camels, seeking\\npasturage and living in tents as the Arabs of the desert do to this day.', 'In\\nthe book of Genesis one has a glimpse of this nomad life. The Patriarchs. â€”The tribe was like a great family; it was composed of the\\nchief, his wives, his children, and his servants.', 'The chief had absolute\\nauthority over all; for the tribe he was father, priest, judge, and king. We\\ncall these tribal chiefs patriarchs. The principal ones were Abraham and\\nJacob; the former the father of the Hebrews, the latter of the Israelites.', 'The\\nBible represents both of them as designed by God to be the scions of a\\nsacred people. Abraham made a covenant with God that he and his\\ndescendants would obey him; God promised to Abraham a posterity more\\nnumerous than the stars of heaven. Jacob received from God the assurance\\nthat a great nation should issue from himself.', 'The Israelites. â€”Moved by a vision Jacob took the name of Israel (contender\\nwith God). His tribe was called Beni-Israel (sons of Israel) or Israelites.', 'The\\nBible records that, driven by famine, Jacob abandoned the Jordan country\\nto settle with all his house on the eastern frontier of Egypt, to which Joseph,\\none of his sons who had become minister of a Pharaoh, invited him. There\\nthe sons of Israel abode for several centuries. Coming hither but seventy in\\nnumber, they multiplied, according to the Bible, until they became six\\nhundred thousand men, without counting women and children.', 'The Call of Moses. â€”The king of Egypt began to oppress them, compelling\\nthem to make mortar and bricks for the construction of his strong cities. It\\nwas then that one of them, Moses, received from God the mission to deliver\\nthem.', 'One day while he was keeping his herds on the mountain, an angel\\nappeared to him in the midst of a burning bush, and he heard these words:\\n\"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

Sentiments of the Israelites.', 'â€”Faithful Israelites regarded these woes as a\\nchastisement: God was punishing his people for their disobedience; as\\nbefore, he delivered them from their conquerors. \"The children of Israel\\nhad sinned against Jehovah, their God, they had built them high places in\\nevery city, they imitated the nations around them, although the Lord had\\nforbidden them to do like them; they made them idols of brass; they bowed\\nthemselves before all the host of heaven [the stars], they worshipped Baal.

They called the Israelites to repent, to overthrow their idols, to\\nreturn to Jehovah; they foretold all the woes that would come upon them if\\nthey did not reconcile themselves to him. They preached and uttered\\nprophecies at the same time.', 'The New Teaching. â€”These men on fire with the divine spirit found the\\nofficial religion at Jerusalem mean and cold.

Hebrew is the primitive language of Israel; the Jews since the\\nreturn from Babylon no longer spoke it, but adopted the languages of the\\nneighboring peoplesâ€”the Syriac, the Chaldean, and especially the Greek. The Rabbis, however, instructed in the religion, still learned the Hebrew,\\nexplained it, and commented on the Scripture.', 'Thus the Jewish religion\\nwas preserved, and, thanks to it, the Jewish people. It made converts even\\namong the Gentiles; there were in the empire proselytes, that is, people\\nwho practised the religion of Jehovah without being of the Jewish race. The Christian Church, powerful since the fourth century, commenced to\\npersecute the Jews.', 'This persecution has endured to this day in all\\nChristian countries. Usually the Jews were tolerated on account of their\\nwealth and because they transacted all banking operations; but they were\\nkept apart, not being permitted to hold any office.

A central chain, the Pindus, traverses Greece through the centre and covers\\nit with its rocky system.', 'Toward the isthmus of Corinth it becomes lower;\\nbut the Peloponnesus, on the other side of the isthmus, is elevated about\\n2,000 feet above the sea level, like a citadel crowned with lofty chains,\\nabrupt and snowy, which fall perpendicularly into the sea. The islands\\nthemselves scattered along the coast are only submerged mountains whose\\nsummits rise above the surface of the sea. In this diverse land there is little\\ntillable ground, but almost everywhere bare rock.', 'The streams, like brooks,\\nleave between their half-dried channel and the sterile rock of the mountain\\nonly a narrow strip of fertile soil. In this beautiful country are found some\\nforests, cypresses, laurels, palms, here and there vines scattered on the\\nrocky hillsides; but there are no rich harvests and no green pasturages. Such a country produces wiry mountaineers, active and sober.', 'The Sea. â€”Greece is a land of shores: smaller than Portugal, it has as great a\\ncoast-line as Spain. The sea penetrates it to a great number of gulfs, coves,\\nand indentations; it is ordinarily surrounded with projecting rocks, or with\\napproaching islands that form a natural port.', 'This sea is like a lake; it has\\nnot, like the ocean, a pale and sombre color; usually it is calm, lustrous,\\nand, as Homer says, \"of the color of violets. \"\\nNo sea lends itself better to navigation with small ships. Every morning the\\nnorth wind rises to conduct the barques of Athens to Asia; in the evening\\nthe south wind brings them back to port.', 'From Greece to Asia Minor the\\nislands are placed like stepping-stones; on a clear day the mariner always\\nhas land in view. Such a sea beckons people to cross it. And so the Greeks have been sailors, traders, travellers, pirates, and\\nadventurers; like the PhÅ“nicians, they have spread over all the ancient\\nworld, carrying with them the merchandise and the inventions of Egypt, of\\nChaldea, and of Asia.', 'The Climate. â€”The climate of Greece is mild. In Athens it freezes hardly\\nonce in twenty years; in summer the heat is moderated by the breeze from\\nthe sea.', 'Today the people still lie in the streets from the month of May to\\nSeptember. The air is cool and transparent; for many leagues could once be\\nseen the crest of the statue of Pallas. The contours of distant mountains are\\nnot, as with us, enveloped in haze, but show a clear line against the clear\\nsky.', 'It is a beautiful country which urges man to take life as a feast, for\\neverything is happy about him. \"Walking at night in the gardens, listening\\nto the grasshoppers, playing the lute in the clear of the moon, going to\\ndrink at the spring at the mountain, carrying with him some wine that he\\nmay drink while he sings, spending the days in dancingâ€”these are Greek\\npleasures, the joys of a race poor, economical, and eternally young. \"\\nSimplicity of Greek Life.', 'â€”In this country men are not melted with the heat\\nnor stiffened with cold; they live in the open air gay and at slight expense. Food in great quantity is not required, nor warm clothing, nor a\\ncomfortable house. The Greek could live on a handful of olives and a\\nsardine.', 'His entire clothing consisted of sandals, a tunic, a large mantle;\\nvery often he went bare-footed and bare-headed.

A\\ncouch with some coverings, a coffer, some beautiful vases, a lamp,â€”this\\nwas his furniture.', 'The walls were bare and whitened with lime. This house\\nwas only a sleeping place. THE PEOPLE\\nOrigin of the Greeks.', 'â€”The people who inhabited this charming little land\\nwere an Aryan people, related to the Hindoos and the Persians, and like\\nthem come from the mountains of Asia or the steppes beyond the Caspian\\nSea. The Greeks had forgotten the long journey made by their ancestors;\\nthey said that they, like the grasshoppers, were the children of the soil. But\\ntheir language and the names of their gods leave no doubt of their origin.', 'Like all the Aryans, the primitive Greeks nourished themselves with milk\\nand with the flesh of their herds; they moved about under arms, always\\nready to fight, and grouped themselves in tribes governed by patriarchs. The Legends. â€”The Greeks like all the other ancient peoples were ignorant\\nof their origin.', 'They neither knew whence their ancestors had come nor\\nwhen they had established themselves in Greece, nor what they had done\\nthere. To preserve the exact memory of things as they occur, there is need\\nof some means of fixing them; but the Greeks did not know how to write;\\nthey did not employ writing until about the eighth century B. C.', 'They had\\nno way of calculating the number of years. Later they adopted the usage of\\ncounting the years according to the great feast which was celebrated every\\nfour years at Olympia; a period of four years was called an olympiad. But\\nthe first olympiad was placed in 776 B.', 'C. , and the chronology of the Greeks\\ndoes not rise beyond this date. And yet they used to tell in Greece a great number of legends about this\\nprimitive period.', 'These were especially the exploits of ancient kings and of\\nheroes who were adored as demi-gods. These stories were so mingled with\\nfable that it is impossible to know how much truth they may contain. They\\nsaid at Athens that the first king, Cecrops, was half man and half serpent;\\nat Thebes, that Cadmus, founder of the city, had come from PhÅ“nicia to\\nseek his sister Europa who had been stolen by a bull; that he had killed a\\ndragon and had sowed his teeth, from which was sprung a race of\\nwarriors, and that the noble families of Thebes descended from these\\nwarriors.', 'At Argos it was said that the royal family was the issue of Pelops\\nto whom Zeus had given a shoulder of ivory to replace the one devoured\\nby a goddess. Thus each country had its legends and the Greeks continued\\nto the end to relate them and to offer worship to their ancient heroesâ€”\\nPerseus, Bellerophon, Herakles, Theseus, Minos, Castor and Pollux,\\nMeleager, Å’dipus. The majority of the Greeks, even among the better\\neducated, admitted, at least in part, the truth of these traditions.', 'They\\naccepted as historical facts the war between the two sons of Å’dipus, king\\nof Thebes, and the expedition of the Argonauts, sailing forth in quest of the\\nGolden Fleece, which was guarded by two brazen-footed bulls vomiting\\nflames. The Trojan War. â€”Of all these legends the most fully developed and the\\nmost celebrated was the legend of the Trojan War.', 'It recounted that about\\nthe twelfth century, Troy, a rich and powerful city, held sway over the\\ncoast of Asia. Paris, a Trojan prince, having come to Greece, had abducted\\nHelen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Agamemnon, king of Argos, made\\na league of the kings of Greece; a Greek army went in a fleet of two\\nhundred galleys to besiege Troy.', 'The siege endured ten years because the\\nsupreme god, Zeus, had taken the side of the Trojans. All the Greek chiefs\\nparticipated in this adventure. Achilles, the bravest and the most beautiful\\nof these, killed Hector, the principal defender of Troy, and dragged his\\ncorpse around the city; he fought clad in divine armor which had been\\npresented him by his mother, a goddess of the sea; in turn he died, shot by\\nan arrow in the heel.', 'The Greeks, despairing of taking the city by force,\\nemployed a trick: they pretended to depart, and left an immense horse of\\nwood in which were concealed the chiefs of the army. The Trojans drew\\nthis horse into the city; during the night the chiefs came forth and opened\\nthe city to the Greeks. Troy was burnt, the men slaughtered, the women led\\naway as slaves.', 'But the chiefs of the Greeks on their return were beset by\\ntempest. Some perished in the sea, others were cast on foreign shores. Odysseus, the most crafty of the chiefs, was for ten years buffeted from one\\nland to another, losing successively all his ships, himself the sole survivor\\nof the disasters.', 'All antiquity had steadfast faith in the Trojan War. 1184 B. C.', 'was set as the\\ndate of the ending of the siege, and men pointed out the site of the city. In\\n1874 Schliemann purposed to excavate this site; it was necessary to traverse\\nthe dÃ©bris of many cities which lay over it; at last at a depth of about fifty\\nfeet he found in the deepest bed of dÃ©bris the traces of a mighty city\\nreduced to ashes, and in the ruins of the principal edifice a casket filled\\nwith gems of gold which he called the Treasury of Priam. There was no\\ninscription, and the city, the whole wall of which we have been able to\\nbring to light, was a very small one.', 'A large number of small, very rude\\nidols have been found, which represent an owl-headed goddess (the\\nGreeks thus represented the goddess Pallas). Beyond this no proof has been\\nfound that this city was called Troy. The Homeric Poems.', 'â€”It is the two poems attributed to Homer which have\\nmade the taking of Troy renowned throughout the worldâ€”the Iliad, which\\nrelated the combats of the Greeks and the exploits of Achilles before Troy;\\nand the Odyssey, which recounts the adventures of Odysseus (Ulysses)\\nafter the capture of Troy. These two poems were handed down for centuries without being\\ncommitted to writing; the rhapsodists, wandering singers, knew long\\npassages from them by heart and recited them at feasts. It is not till the\\nsixth century that Pisistratus, a prince of Athens, had them collected and\\nedited.', 'The two poems became from that time and always remained the\\nmost admired works of Greek literature. The Greeks said that the author of these poems was Homer, a Greek of\\nIonia, who lived about the tenth or the ninth century B. C.', 'They represented\\nhim as a blind old man, poor and a wanderer. Seven towns disputed the\\nhonor of being his birth-place. This tradition was received without\\nhesitation.', 'But at the end of the eighteenth century a German scholar, Wolf,\\nnoticed certain contradictions in these poems, and at last asserted that they\\nwere not the work of a single poet, but a collection of fragments from\\nseveral different poets. This theory has been attacked and supported with\\ngreat energy: for a half century men have flown into a passion for or\\nagainst the existence of Homer. Today we begin to think the problem\\ninsoluble.', 'What is certain is that these poems are very old, probably of the\\nninth century. The Iliad was composed in Asia Minor and is perhaps the\\nresult of the union of two poemsâ€”one dedicated to the combats of the\\nTrojans, and the other to the adventures of Achilles. The Odyssey appears\\nto be the work of one author; but it cannot be affirmed that it is of the same\\nauthor as the Iliad.', 'The Greeks at the Time of Homer. â€”We are not able to go back very far in\\nthe history of the Greeks; the Homeric poems are their oldest historical\\ndocument. When these were composed, about the ninth century B.', 'C. , there\\nwas not yet any general name to designate all the inhabitants of Greece:\\nHomer mentions them under the names of their principal tribes. From his\\ndescription it appears that they have made some progress since their\\ndeparture from Asia.', 'They know how to till the ground, how to construct\\nstrong cities and to organize themselves into little peoples. They obey\\nkings; they have a council of old men and an assembly of the people. They\\nare proud of their institutions, they despise their less advanced neighbors,\\nthe Barbarians, as they call them.', 'Odysseus, to show how rude the Cyclops\\nwere, says, \"They have no rules of justice nor places where they deliberate;\\neach one governs himself, his wife, and children, and has no association\\nwith others. \" But these Greeks themselves are half barbarians; they do not\\nknow how to write, to coin money, nor the art of working in iron. They\\nhardly dare to trust themselves on the sea and they imagine that Sicily is\\npeopled with monsters.', 'The Dorians. â€”Dorians was the name given to those sons of the\\nmountaineers who had come from the north and had expelled or subjected\\nthose dwelling in the plains and on the shore of the Peloponnesus; the\\nlatter, crowded into too narrow limits, sent colonies into Asia. Of these\\nmountain bands the most renowned came from a little canton called Doris\\nand preserved the name Dorians.', 'These invaders told how certain kings of\\nSparta, the posterity of Herakles, having been thrust out by their subjects,\\nhad come to seek the Dorians in their mountains. These people of the\\nmountains, moved by their love for Herakles, had followed his\\ndescendants and had replaced them on their throne. By the same stroke\\nthey dispossessed the inhabitants and took their place.', 'They were a\\nmartial, robust, and healthy race, accustomed to cold, to meagre food, to a\\nscant existence.

But the majority of the Greeks are neither Dorians nor\\nIonians: they are called Ã†olians, a vague name which covers very different\\npeoples. All the Greeks from early times take the name \"Hellenes\" which they have\\nkept to this day.', 'What is the origin of the term? They did not know any\\nmore than we: they said only that Dorus and Ã†olus were sons of Hellen,\\nand Ion was his grandson. Cities. â€”The Hellenes were still in little peoples as at the time of Homer.', 'The land of Greece, cut by mountains and sea, breaks naturally into a large\\nnumber of small cantons, each isolated from its neighbor by an arm of the\\nsea or by a wall of rocks, so that it is easy to defend the land and difficult to\\ncommunicate with other parts. Each canton constituted a separate state\\nwhich was called a city. There were more than a hundred of these;\\ncounting the colonies, more than a thousand.', 'To us a Greek state seems a\\nminiature. The whole of Attica was but little larger than the state of\\nDelaware, and Corinth or Megara was much smaller. Usually the state was\\nonly a city with a strip of shore and a harbor, or some villages scattered in\\nthe plain around a citadel.', 'From one state one sees the citadel, mountains,\\nor harbor of the next state. Many of them count their citizens only by\\nthousands; the largest included hardly 200,000 or 300,000. The Hellenes never formed one nation; they never ceased to fight and\\ndestroy one another.', 'And yet all spoke the same language, worshipped the\\nsame gods, and lived the same sort of a life. In these respects they\\nrecognized the bonds of a common race and distinguished themselves from\\nall other peoples whom they called barbarians and regarded with disdain. THE HELLENES BEYOND SEA\\nColonization.', 'â€”The Hellenes did not inhabit Greece alone. Colonists from\\nthe Greek cities had gone forth to found new cities in all the neighboring\\ncountries. There were little states in all the islands of the Archipelago, over\\nall the coast of Asia Minor, in Crete and Cyprus, on the whole\\ncircumference of the Black Sea as far as the Caucasus and the Crimea, along\\nthe shore of Turkey in Europe (then called Thrace), on the shore of Africa,\\nin Sicily, in south Italy, and even on the coasts of France and Spain.', 'Character of These Colonies. â€”Greek colonies were being founded all the\\ntime from the twelfth century to the fifth; they issued from various cities\\nand represented all the Greek racesâ€”Dorian, Ionian, and Ã†olian. They\\nwere established in the wilderness, in an inhabited land, by conquest, or by\\nan agreement with the natives.', 'Mariners, merchants, exiles, or adventurers\\nwere their founders. But with all this diversity of time, place, race, and\\norigin, the colonies had common characteristics: they were established at\\none stroke and according to certain fixed rules. The colonists did not arrive\\none by one or in small bands; nor did they settle at random, building\\nhouses which little by little became a city, as is the case now with European\\ncolonists in America.', 'All the colonists started at once under a leader, and\\nthe new city was founded in one day. The foundation was a religious\\nceremony; the \"founder\" traced a sacred enclosure, constructed a sacred\\nhearth, and lighted there the holy fire. Traditions Concerning the Colonists.', 'â€”The old stories about the founding\\nof some of these colonies enable us to see how they differed from modern\\ncolonies. The account of the settlement of Marseilles runs as follows:\\nEuxenus, a citizen of PhocÃ¦a, coming to Gaul in a merchant galley, was\\ninvited by a Gallic chief to the marriage of his daughter; according to the\\ncustom of this people, the young girl about the time of the feast entered\\nbearing a cup which she was to present to the one whom she would choose\\nfor a husband; she stopped before the Greek and offered him the cup. This\\nunpremeditated act appeared to have been inspired from heaven; the Gallic\\nchief gave his daughter to Euxenus and permitted him and his companions\\nto found a city on the gulf of Marseilles.', 'Later the PhocÃ¦ans, seeing their\\ncity blockaded by the Persian army, loaded on their ships their families,\\ntheir movables, the statues and treasures of their temple and went to sea,\\nabandoning their city. As they started, they threw into the sea a mass of\\nred-hot iron and swore never to return to PhocÃ¦a until the iron should rise\\nto the surface of the water. Many violated this oath and returned; but the\\nrest continued the voyage and after many adventures came to Marseilles.', 'At Miletus the Ionians who founded the city had brought no wives with\\nthem; they seized a city inhabited by the natives of Asia, slaughtered all the\\nmen, and forcibly married the women and girls of the families of their\\nvictims. It was said that the women, affronted in this manner, swore never\\nto eat food with their captors and never to call them by the name of\\nhusband; this custom was for centuries preserved among the women of\\nMiletus. The colony at Cyrene in Africa was founded according to the express\\ncommand of the oracle of Apollo.', 'The inhabitants of Thera, who had\\nreceived this order, did not care to go to an unknown country. They\\nyielded only at the end of seven years since their island was afflicted with\\ndearth; they believed that Apollo had sent misfortune on them as a penalty. Nevertheless the citizens who were sent out attempted to abandon the\\nenterprise, but their fellow-citizens attacked them and forced them to\\nreturn.', 'After having spent two years on an island where no success came to\\nthem, they at last came to settle at Cyrene, which soon became a\\nprosperous city. Importance of the Colonies. â€”Wherever they settled, the colonists\\nconstituted a new state which in no respect obeyed the mother town from\\nwhich they had come out.', 'And so the whole Mediterranean found itself\\nsurrounded by Greek cities independent one of the others. Of these cities\\nmany became richer and more powerful than their mother towns; they had\\na territory which was larger and more fertile, and in consequence a greater\\npopulation. Sybaris, it was said, had 300,000 men who were capable of\\nbearing arms.', 'Croton could place in the field an infantry force of 120,000\\nmen. Syracuse in Sicily, Miletus in Asia had greater armies than even\\nSparta and Athens. South Italy was termed Great Greece.', 'In comparison\\nwith this great country fully peopled with Greek colonies the home\\ncountry was, in fact, only a little Greece. And so it happened that the\\nGreeks were much more numerous in the neighboring countries than in\\nGreece proper; and among these people of the colonies figure a good share\\nof the most celebrated names: Homer, AlcÃ¦us, Sappho, Thales, Pythagoras,\\nHeraclitus, Democritus, Empedocles, Aristotle, Archimedes, Theocritus,\\nand many others. CHAPTER X\\nGREEK RELIGION\\nThe Gods.', 'Polytheism. â€”The Greeks, like the ancient Aryans, believed in\\nmany gods. They had neither the sentiment of infinity nor that of eternity;\\nthey did not conceive of God as one for whom the heavens are only a tent\\nand the earth a foot-stool.', 'To the Greeks every force of natureâ€”the air, the\\nsun, the seaâ€”was divine, and as they did not conceive of all these\\nphenomena as produced by one cause, they assigned each to a particular\\ngod. This is the reason that they believed in many gods. They were\\npolytheists.', 'Anthropomorphism. â€”Each god was a force in nature and carried a distinct\\nname. The Greeks, having a lively imagination, figured under this name a\\nliving being, of beautiful form and human characteristics.', 'A god or\\ngoddess was represented as a beautiful man or woman. When Odysseus or\\nTelemachus met a person peculiarly great and beautiful, they began by\\nasking him if he were not a god. Homer in describing the army pictured on\\nthe shield of Achilles adds, \"Ares and Athena led the army, both clad in\\ngold, beautiful and great, as becomes the gods, for men were smaller.', '\"\\nGreek gods are men; they have clothing, palaces, bodies similar to ours; if\\nthey cannot die, they can at least be wounded. Homer relates how Ares, the\\ngod of war, struck by a warrior, fled howling with pain. This fashion of\\nmaking gods like men is what is called Anthropomorphism.', 'Mythology. â€”The gods, being men, have parents, children, property. Their\\nmothers were goddesses, their brothers were gods, and their children other\\ngods or men who were half divine.', 'This genealogy of the gods is what is\\ncalled the Theogony. The gods have also a history; we are told the story of\\ntheir birth, the adventures of their youth, their exploits. Apollo, for\\nexample, was born on the island of Delos to which his mother Latona had\\nfled; he slew a monster which was desolating the country at the foot of\\nParnassus.', 'Each canton of Greece had thus its tales of the gods. These are\\ncalled myths; the sum of them is termed Mythology, or the history of the\\ngods. The Local Gods.', 'â€”The Greek gods, even under their human form,\\nremained what they were at first, phenomena of nature. They were thought\\nof both as men and as forces of nature. The Naiad is a young woman, but at\\nthe same time a bubbling fountain.', 'Homer represents the river Xanthus as\\na god, and yet he says, \"The Xanthus threw itself on Achilles, boiling with\\nfury, full of tumult, foam, and the bodies of the dead. \" The people itself\\ncontinued to say \"Zeus rains\" or \"Zeus thunders. \" To the Greek the god was\\nfirst of all rain, storm, heaven, or sun, and not the heaven, sun, or earth in\\ngeneral, but that corner of the heaven under which he lived, the land of his\\ncanton, the river which traversed it.', 'Each city, then, had its divinities, its\\nsun-god, its earth-goddess, its sea-god, and these are not to be confounded\\nwith the sun, the earth, and the sea of the neighboring city. The Zeus of\\nSparta is not the same as the Zeus of Athens; in the same oath one\\nsometimes invokes two Athenas or two Apollos. A traveller who would\\njourney through Greece would therefore meet thousands of local gods\\n(they called them Poliades, or gods of the city).', 'No torrent, no wood, no\\nmountain was without its own deity, although often a minor divinity,\\nadored only by the people of the vicinity and whose sanctuary was only a\\ngrotto in the rock. The Great Gods. â€”Above the innumerable legion of local gods of each\\ncanton the Greeks imagined certain great divinitiesâ€”the heaven, the sun,\\nthe earth, and the seaâ€”and these everywhere had the same name, and had\\ntheir temple or sanctuary in every place.', 'Each represented one of the\\nprincipal forces of nature. These gods common to all the Greeks were never\\nnumerous; if all are included, we have hardly twenty. We have the bad\\nhabit of calling them by the name of a Latin god.', 'The following are their\\ntrue names: Zeus (Jupiter), Hera (Juno), Athena (Minerva), Apollo, Artemis\\n(Diana), Hermes (Mercury), Hephaistos (Vulcan), Hestia (Vesta), Ares\\n(Mars), Aphrodite (Venus), Poseidon (Neptune), Amphitrite, Proteus,\\nKronos (Saturn), Rhea (Cybele), Demeter (Ceres), Persephone (Proserpina),\\nHades (Pluto), Dionysos (Bacchus). It is this little group of gods that men\\nworshipped in all the temples, that men ordinarily invoked in their\\nprayers. Attributes of the Gods.', 'â€”Each of these great gods had his form, his\\ncostume, his instruments (which we call his attributes); it is thus that the\\nfaithful imagined him and that the sculptors represented him. Each has his\\ncharacter which is well known to his worshippers. Each has his rÃ´le in the\\nworld, performing his determined functions, ordinarily with the aid of\\nsecondary divinities who obey him.', 'Athena, virgin of clear eye, is represented standing, armed with a lance, a\\nhelmet on the head, and gleaming armor on the breast. She is the goddess\\nof the clear air, of wisdom, and of invention, a goddess of dignity and\\nmajesty. Hephaistos, the god of fire, is figured with a hammer and in the form of a\\nlame and ugly blacksmith.', 'It is he who forges the thunderbolt. Artemis, shy maiden, armed with bow and quiver, courses the forests\\nhunting with a troop of nymphs. She is the goddess of the woods, of the\\nchase, and of death.', 'Hermes, represented with winged sandals, is the god of the fertile showers. But he has other offices; he is the god of streets and squares, the god of\\ncommerce, of theft, and of eloquence. He it is who guides the souls of the\\ndead, the messenger of the gods, the deity presiding over the breeding of\\ncattle.', 'Almost always a Greek god has several functions, quite dissimilar to our\\neyes, but to the Greeks bearing some relation to one another. Olympus and Zeus. â€”Each one of these gods is like a king in his own\\ndomain.', 'Still the Greeks had remarked that all the forces of nature do not\\noperate by chance and that they act in harmony; the same word served\\nthem for the idea of order and of universe. They supposed, then, that the\\ngods were in accord for the administration of the world, and that they, like\\nmen, had laws and government among them. In the north of Greece there was a mountain to whose snowy summit no\\nman had ever climbed.', 'This was Olympus. On this summit, which was\\nhidden by clouds from the eyes of men, it was imagined the gods\\nassembled. Meeting under the light of heaven, they conferred on the affairs\\nof the world.', 'Zeus, the mightiest of them, presided over the gathering: he\\nwas god of the heavens and of the light, the god \"who masses the clouds,\"\\nwho launches the thunderboltâ€”an old man of majestic mien, with long\\nbeard, sitting on a throne of gold. It is he who commands and the other\\ngods bow before him. Should they essay to resist, Zeus menaces them;\\nHomer makes him say, \"Bind to heaven a chain of gold, and all of you,\\ngods or goddesses, throw your weight upon it; all your united efforts\\ncannot draw Zeus, the sovereign ordainer, to the earth.', 'On the contrary, if I\\nwished to draw the chain to myself, I should bring with it the earth and the\\nvery sea. Then I would attach it to the summit of Olympus and all the\\nuniverse would be suspended. By so much am I superior to gods and men.', '\"\\nMorality of the Greek Mythology. â€”The greater part of their gods were\\nconceived by the Greeks as violent, sanguinary, deceitful, dissolute. They\\nascribed to them scandalous adventures or dishonest acts.', 'Hermes was\\nnotorious for his thieving, Aphrodite for her coquetry, Ares for his ferocity. All were so vain as to persecute those who neglected to offer sacrifices to\\nthem. Niobe had seen all her children pierced with arrows by Apollo\\nbecause she herself had boasted of her numerous family.', 'The gods were so\\njealous that they could not endure seeing a man thoroughly happy;\\nprosperity for the Greeks was the greatest of dangers, for it never failed to\\ndraw the anger of the gods, and this anger became a goddess (Nemesis)\\nabout whom were told such anecdotes as the following: Once Polycrates of\\nSamos, become very powerful, feared the jealousy of the gods; and so a\\nring of gold which he still retained was cast into the sea that his good\\nfortune might not be unmixed with evil. Some time after, a fisherman\\nbrought to Polycrates an enormous fish and in its belly was found the ring. This was a certain presage of evil.', 'Polycrates was besieged in his city,\\ntaken, and crucified. The gods punished him for his good fortune. Greek mythology was immoral in that the gods gave bad examples to men.', 'The Greek philosophers were already saying this and were inveighing\\nagainst the poets who had published these stories. A disciple of Pythagoras\\naffirmed that his master, descending to hell, had seen the soul of Homer\\nhanging to a tree and that of Hesiod bound to a column to punish them for\\ncalumniating the gods. \"Homer and Hesiod,\" Said Xenophanes, \"attribute\\nto the gods all the acts which among men are culpable and shameful; there\\nis but one god who neither in body nor in soul resembles men.', '\" And he\\nadded this profound remark: \"If oxen and lions had hands and could\\nmanipulate like men, they would have made gods with bodies similar to\\ntheir own, horses would have framed gods with horses\\' bodies, and cattle\\nwith cattle\\'s. Men think that the gods have their feelings, their voice, and\\ntheir body. \" Xenophanes was right; the primitive Greeks had created their\\ngods in their own image.', 'As they were then sanguinary, dissolute, jealous,\\nand vain, their gods were the same. Later, as the people became better,\\ntheir descendants were shocked with all these vices; but the history and the\\ncharacter of the gods were fixed by the ancient traditions, and later\\ngenerations, without daring to change them, had received the gross and\\ndishonest gods of their ancestors. THE HEROES\\nThe Hero.', 'â€”The hero in Greece is a man who has become illustrious, and\\nafter death a mighty spiritâ€”not a god, but a demi-god. The heroes do not\\nlive on Olympus in the heaven of the gods, they do not direct the life of the\\nworld. And yet they, too, possess a power higher than that of any human,\\nand this permits them to aid their friends and destroy their enemies.', 'For\\nthis reason the Greeks rendered them worship as to the gods and implored\\ntheir protection. There was not a city, not a tribe, not a family but had its\\nhero, a protecting spirit which it adored. Different Kinds of Heroes.', 'â€”Of these heroes many are legendary persons\\n(Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon); some without doubt never existed\\n(Herakles, Å’dipus); others like Hellen, Dorus, Ã†olus are only names. But\\ntheir worshippers regarded them as men of the olden time; and, in fact, the\\nmost of the heroes lived at one time. Many are historical personages:\\ngenerals like Leonidas, Lysander; philosophers like Democritus and\\nAristotle; legislators like Lycurgus and Solon.', 'The people of Croton adored\\neven one of their fellow-citizens, Philip by name, because he had been in\\nhis time the most beautiful man in Greece. The leader who had guided a\\nband of colonists and founded a city became for the inhabitants the\\nFounder; a temple was raised to him and every year sacrifices were offered\\nto him. The Athenian Miltiades was thus worshipped in a city of Thrace.', 'The Spartiate Brasidas, killed in the defence of Amphipolis, had divine\\nhonors paid to him in that city, for the inhabitants had come to regard him\\nas their Founder. Presence of the Heroes. â€”The hero continued to reside in the place where\\nhis body was interred, either in his tomb or in the neighborhood.', 'A story\\ntold by Herodotus (v. 67) depicts this belief in a lively way. The city of\\nSicyon adored the hero Adrastus and in a public place was a chapel\\ndedicated to his honor.', 'Cleisthenes, the tyrant of Sicyon, took a fancy to rid\\nhimself of this hero. He went to the oracle at Delphi to ask if it would aid\\nhim in expelling Adrastus. The oracle replied to his question that Adrastus\\nwas king of the Sicyonians and Cleisthenes was a brigand.', 'The tyrant, not\\ndaring to evict the hero, adopted a ruse; he sent to Thebes to seek the bones\\nof Melanippus, another hero, and installed them with great pomp in the\\nsanctuary of the city. \"He did this,\" says Herodotus, \"because Melanippus\\nduring his life had been the greatest enemy of Adrastus and had killed his\\nbrother and his son-in-law. \" Then he transferred to Melanippus the\\nfestivals and the sacrifices formerly paid to the honor of Adrastus.', 'He was\\npersuaded, and all the Greeks with him, that the hero would be irritated\\nand would flee. Intervention of the Heroes. â€”The heroes have divine power; like the gods,\\nthey can according to their whim send good or evil.', 'The poet Stesichorus\\nhad spoken ill of the famous Helen (that Helen who the legend states was\\ncarried away to Troy); he suddenly became blind; when he retracted what\\nhe had said, the heroine restored his sight. The protecting heroes of a city kept it from plagues and famine and even\\nfought against its enemies. At the battle of the Marathon the Athenian\\nsoldiers saw in the midst of them Theseus, the mythical founder of Athens,\\nclad in shining armor.', 'During the battle of Salamis the heroes Ajax and\\nTelamon, once kings of Salamis, appeared on the highest point of the island\\nextending their hands to the Greek fleet. \"It is not we,\" said Themistocles,\\n\"that have vanquished the Persians; it is the gods and heroes. \" In \"Å’dipus\\nat Colonus,\" a tragedy of Sophocles, Å’dipus at the point of death receives\\nthe visit of the king of Athens and of the king of Thebes, both of whom as\\ngods request him to have his body interred in their territory, and to become\\na protecting hero.', 'Å’dipus at last consents to be buried in the soil of the\\nAthenians, and says to the king, \"Dead, I shall not be a useless inhabitant of\\nthis country, I shall be a rampart for you, stronger than millions of\\nwarriors. \" In himself alone a hero was as efficient as a whole army; his\\nspirit was mightier than all living men. WORSHIP\\nPrinciples of Worship of the Gods.', 'â€”Gods and heroes, potent as they were,\\nbestowed on men all good or evil fortune according to their will. It was\\ndangerous to have them against you, wise to have them on your side. They\\nwere conceived as like men, irritated if they were neglected, contented if\\nthey were venerated.', 'On this principle worship was based. It consisted in\\ndoing things agreeable to the gods to obtain their favor. Plato expresses as\\nfollows the thought of the common man, \"To know how to say and do\\nthose things that are pleasing to the gods, either in prayers or in offerings,\\nthis is piety which brings prosperity to individuals and to states.', 'The\\nreverse is impiety which ruins everything. \" \"It is natural,\" says Xenophon\\nat the end of his treatise on Cavalry, \"that the gods should favor those\\nespecially who not only consult them in need, but honor them in the day of\\nprosperity. \" Religion was first of all a contract; the Greek sought to delight\\nthe gods and in return required their services.', '\"For a long time,\" says a\\npriest of Apollo to his god, \"I have burned fat bullocks for you; now grant\\nmy petitions and discharge your arrows against my enemies. \"\\nThe Great Festivals. â€”Since the gods had the feelings of men they were to\\nbe pleased in the same way as men.', 'Wine, cakes, fruits, food were brought\\nto them. Palaces were built for them. Festivals were given in their honor,\\nfor they were \"joyous gods\" who loved pleasure and beautiful spectacles.', 'A\\nfestival was not, as with us, purely an occasion of rejoicing, but a religious\\nceremony. On those days free from the daily toil men were required to\\nrejoice in public before the god. The Greek, without doubt, delighted in\\nthese fÃªtes; but it is for the god and not for himself that he celebrates them.', '\"The Ionians,\" says an ancient hymn to Apollo, \"delight thee with trial of\\nstrength, the hymn, and the dance. \"\\nThe Sacred Games. â€”From these diversions offered to the gods originated\\nthe solemn games.', 'Each city had them to the honor of its gods; ordinarily\\nonly its citizens were admitted to them; but in four districts of Greece were\\ncelebrated games at which all Greeks could be present and participate. These are called the Four Great Games. The principal of these four festivals was that at Olympia.', 'This was given\\nevery four years in honor of Zeus and continued five or six days. The\\nmultitude coming from all parts of Greece filled the amphitheatre. They\\ncommenced by sacrificing victims and addressing prayers to Zeus and the\\nother gods.', 'Then came the contests; they were:\\nThe foot-race around the stadion. The Pentathlon, so called because it comprised five exercises. The\\ncompetitors were to leap, run from one end of the stadion to the other,\\nmake a long throw of the metal discus, hurl the javelin, and wrestle.', 'Boxing, in which one fought with arms bound with thongs of hide. The chariot races, which were held in the hippodrome; the cars were light\\nand were drawn by four horses. The judges of the games were clothed in purple, crowned with laurel.', 'After\\nthe combat a herald proclaimed before the whole assembly the name of the\\nvictor and of his city. A crown of olive was the only reward given him; but\\nhis fellow-citizens on his return received him as a conquering hero;\\nsometimes they threw down a section of the city wall to give him entrance. He arrived in a chariot drawn by four horses, clothed in purple, escorted\\nby all the people.', '\"These victories which we leave today to the athletes of\\nthe public shows appeared then the greatest of all. Poets of greatest renown\\ncelebrated them; Pindar, the most illustrious lyric poet of antiquity, has\\nhardly done more than sing of chariot races. It is related that a certain\\nDiagoras, who had seen his two sons crowned on the same day, was borne\\nin triumph by them in the sight of the spectators.', \"The people, holding such\\nan honor too great for a mortal, cried out, 'Perish, Diagoras, for after all you\\ncannot become a god. ' Diagoras, suffocated with emotion, died in the arms\\nof his sons. In his eyes and the eyes of the Greeks the fact that his sons\\npossessed the stoutest fists and the nimblest limbs in Greece was the acme\\nof earthly happiness.\", '\" The Greeks had their reasons for thus admiring\\nphysical prowess: in their wars in which they fought hand to hand the\\nmost vigorous athletes were the best soldiers. Omens. â€”In return for so much homage, so many festivals and offerings,\\nthe Greeks expected no small amount of service from their gods.', 'The gods\\nprotected their worshippers, gave them health, riches, victory. They\\npreserved them from the evils that menaced them, sending signs which\\nmen interpreted. These are called Omens.', '\"When a city,\" says Herodotus,\\n\"is about to suffer some great misfortune, this is usually anticipated by\\nsigns. The people of Chios had omens of their defeat: of a band of one\\nhundred youths sent to Delphi but two returned; the others had died of the\\nplague. About the same time the roof of a school of the city fell on the\\nchildren who were learning to read; but one escaped of the one hundred\\nand twenty.', 'Such were the anticipating signs sent them by the deity. \"\\nThe Greeks regarded as supernatural signs, dreams, the flight of birds in\\nthe heavens, the entrails of animals sacrificedâ€”in a word, everything that\\nthey saw, from the tremblings of the earth and eclipses to a simple sneeze. In the expedition to Sicily, Nicias, the general of the Athenians, at the\\nmoment of embarking his army for the retreat, was arrested by an eclipse\\nof the moon; the gods, thought he, had sent this prodigy to warn the\\nAthenians not to continue their enterprise.', 'And so Nicias waited; he waited\\ntwenty-seven days offering sacrifices to appease the gods. During this\\ninactivity the enemy closed the port, destroyed the fleet, and exterminated\\nhis army. The Athenians on learning this news found but one thing with\\nwhich to reproach Nicias: he should have known that for an army in retreat\\nthe eclipse of the moon was a favorable sign.', 'During the retreat of the Ten\\nThousand, Xenophon, the general, making an address to his soldiers,\\nuttered this sentiment: \"With the help of the gods we have the surest hope\\nthat we shall save ourselves with glory. \" At this point a soldier sneezed. At\\nonce all adored the god who had sent this omen.', '\"Since at the very instant\\nwhen we are deliberating concerning our safety,\" exclaimed Xenophon,\\n\"Zeus the savior has sent us an omen, let us with one consent offer\\nsacrifices to him. \"\\nThe Oracles. â€”Often the god replies to the faithful who consult him not by\\na mute sign, but by the mouth of an inspired person.', 'The faithful enter the\\nsanctuary of the god seeking responses and counsel. These are Oracles. There were oracles in many places in Greece and Asia.', 'The most noted\\nwere at Dodona in Epirus, and at Delphi, at the foot of Mount Parnassus. At Dodona it was Zeus who spoke by the rustling of the sacred oaks. At\\nDelphi it was Apollo who was consulted.', 'Below his temple, in a grotto, a\\ncurrent of cool air issued from a rift in the ground. This air the Greeks\\nthought was sent by the god, for he threw into a frenzy those who inhaled\\nit. A tripod was placed over the orifice, a woman (the Pythia), prepared by\\na bath in the sacred spring, took her seat on the tripod, and received the\\ninspiration.', 'At once, seized with a nervous frenzy, she uttered cries and\\nbroken sentences. Priests sitting about her caught these expressions, set\\nthem to verse, and brought them to him who sought advice of the god. The oracles of the Pythia were often obscure and ambiguous.', 'When\\nCrÅ“sus asked if he should make war on the Persians, the reply was,\\n\"CrÅ“sus will destroy a great empire. \" In fact, a great empire was destroyed,\\nbut it was that of CrÅ“sus. The Spartans had great confidence in the Pythia, and never initiated an\\nexpedition without consulting her.', 'The other Greeks imitated them, and\\nDelphi thus became a sort of national oracle. Amphictyonies. â€”To protect the sanctuary of Delphi twelve of the principal\\npeoples of Greece had formed an association called an Amphictyony.', 'Every year deputies from these peoples assembled at Delphi to celebrate\\nthe festival of Apollo and see that the temple was not threatened; for this\\ntemple contained immense wealth, a temptation to pillage it. In the sixth\\ncentury the people of Cirrha, a neighboring city of Delphi, appropriated\\nthese treasures, The Amphictyons declared war against them for sacrilege. Cirrha was taken and destroyed, the inhabitants sold as slaves, the territory\\nleft fallow.', 'In the fourth century the Amphictyons made war on the\\nPhocidians also who had seized the treasury of Delphi, and on the people\\nof Amphissa who had tilled a field dedicated to Apollo. Still it is not necessary to believe that the assembly of the Amphictyons\\never resembled a Greek senate. It was concerned only with the temple of\\nApollo, not at all with political affairs.', 'It did not even prevent members of\\nthe Amphictyony fighting one another. The oracle and the Amphictyony of\\nDelphi were more potent than the other oracles and the other\\namphictyonies; but they never united the Greeks into a single nation. CHAPTER XI\\nSPARTA\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nLaconia.', 'â€”When the Dorian mountaineers invaded the Peloponnesus, the\\nmain body of them settled at Sparta in Laconia. Laconia is a narrow valley\\ntraversed by a considerable stream (the Eurotas) flowing between two\\nmassive mountain ranges with snowy summits. A poet describes the\\ncountry as follows: \"A land rich in tillable soil, but hard to cultivate, deep\\nset among perpendicular mountains, rough in aspect, inaccessible to\\ninvasion.', '\" In this enclosed country lived the Dorians of Sparta in the midst\\nof the ancient inhabitants who had become, some their subjects, others\\ntheir serfs. There were, then, in Laconia three classes: Helots, PeriÅ“ci,\\nSpartiates. The Helots.', 'â€”The Helots dwelt in the cottages scattered in the plain and\\ncultivated the soil. But the land did not belong to themâ€”indeed, they were\\nnot even free to leave it. They were, like the serfs of the Middle Ages,\\npeasants attached to the soil, from father to son.', 'They labored for a\\nSpartiate proprietor who took from them the greater part of the harvest. The Spartiates instructed them, feared them, and ill treated them. They\\ncompelled them to wear rude garments, beat them unreasonably to remind\\nthem of their servile condition, and sometimes made them intoxicated to\\ndisgust their children with the sight of drunkenness.', 'A Spartiate poet\\ncompares the Helots to \"loaded asses stumbling under their burdens and\\nthe blows inflicted. \"\\nThe PeriÅ“ci. â€”The PeriÅ“ci (those who live around) inhabited a hundred\\nvillages in the mountains or on the coast.', 'They were sailors, they engaged\\nin commerce, and manufactured the objects necessary to life. They were\\nfree and administered the business of their village, but they paid tribute to\\nthe magistrates of Sparta and obeyed them. Condition of the Spartiates.', 'â€”Helots and PeriÅ“ci despised the Spartiates,\\ntheir masters. \"Whenever one speaks to them of the Spartiates,\" says\\nXenophon, \"there isn\\'t one of them who can conceal the pleasure he would\\nfeel in eating them alive. \" Once an earthquake nearly destroyed Sparta: the\\nHelots at once rushed from all sides of the plain to massacre those of the\\nSpartiates who had escaped the catastrophe.', \"At the same time the PeriÅ“ci\\nrose and refused obedience. The Spartiates' bearing toward the PeriÅ“ci was\\ncertain to exasperate them. At the end of a war in which many of the Helots\\nhad fought in their army, they bade them choose those who had especially\\ndistinguished themselves for bravery, with the promise of freeing them.\", 'It\\nwas a ruse to discover the most energetic and those most capable of\\nrevolting. Two thousand were chosen; they were conducted about the\\ntemples with heads crowned as an evidence of their manumission; then the\\nSpartiates put them out of the way, but how it was done no one ever knew. And yet the oppressed classes were ten times more, numerous than their\\nmasters.', 'While there were more than 200,000 Helots and 120,000 PeriÅ“ci,\\nthere were never more than 9,000 Spartiate heads of families. In a matter of\\nlife and death, then, it was necessary that a Spartiate be as good as ten\\nHelots. As the form of battle was hand-to-hand, they needed agile and\\nrobust men.', 'Sparta was like a camp without walls; its people was an army\\nalways in readiness. EDUCATION\\nThe Children. â€”They began to make soldiers of them at birth.', 'The newlyborn infant was brought before a council; if it was found deformed, it was\\nexposed on the mountain to die; for an army has use only for strong men. The children who were permitted to grow up were taken from their\\nparents at the age of seven years and were trained together as members of\\na group. Both summer and winter they went bare-foot and had but a single\\nmantle.', 'They lay on a heap of reeds and bathed in the cold waters of the\\nEurotas. They ate little and that quickly and had a rude diet. This was to\\nteach them not to satiate the stomach.', 'They were grouped by hundreds,\\neach under a chief. Often they had to contend together with blows of feet\\nand fists. At the feast of Artemis they were beaten before the statue of the\\ngoddess till the blood flowed; some died under this ordeal, but their honor\\nrequired them not to weep.', 'They were taught to fight and suffer. Often they were given nothing to eat; provision must be found by foraging. If they were captured on these predatory expeditions, they were roughly\\nbeaten.', 'A Spartiate boy who had stolen a little fox and had hidden it under\\nhis mantle, rather than betray himself let the animal gnaw out his vitals. They were to learn how to escape from perplexing situations when they\\nwere in the field. They walked with lowered glance, silent, hands under the mantle, without\\nturning the head and \"making no more noise than statues.', '\" They were not\\nto speak at table and were to obey all men that they encountered. This was\\nto accustom them to discipline. The Girls.', 'â€”The other Greeks kept their daughters secluded in the house,\\nspinning flax. The Spartiates would have robust women capable of bearing\\nvigorous children. The girls, therefore, were trained in much the same\\nmanner as the boys.', 'In their gymnasia they practised running, leaping,\\nthrowing the disc and Javelin. A poet describes a play in which Spartiate\\ngirls \"like colts with flowing manes make the dust fly about them. \" They\\nwere reputed the healthiest and bravest women in Greece.', \"The Discipline. â€”The men, too, have their regular life and this a soldier's\\nlife. The presence of many enemies requires that no one shall weaken.\", 'At\\nseventeen years the Spartiate becomes a soldier and this he until he is sixty. The costume, hour of rising and retiring, meals, exerciseâ€”everything is\\nfixed by regulations as in barracks. Since the Spartiate engages only in war, he is to prepare himself for that; he\\nexercises himself in running, leaping, and wielding his arms; he disciplines\\nall the members of the bodyâ€”the neck, the arms, the shoulders, the legs,\\nand that too, every day.', \"He has no right to engage in trade, to pursue an\\nindustry, nor to cultivate the earth; he is a soldier and is not to allow\\nhimself to be diverted to any other occupation. He cannot live at his\\npleasure with his own family; the men eat together in squads; they cannot\\nleave the country without permission. It is the discipline of a regiment in\\nthe enemy's territory.\", 'Laconism. â€”These warriors had a rude life, with clean-cut aims and proud\\ndisposition. They spoke in short phrasesâ€”or as we say, laconicallyâ€”the\\nword has still persisted.', 'The Greeks cited many examples of these\\nexpressions. To a garrison in danger of being surprised the government\\nsent this message, \"Attention!\" A Spartan army was summoned by the king\\nof Persia to lay down his arms; the general replied, \"Come and take them. \"\\nWhen Lysander captured Athens, he wrote simply, \"Athens is fallen.', '\"\\nMusic. The Dance. â€”The arts of Sparta were those that pertained to an\\narmy.', 'The Dorian conquerors brought with them a peculiar sort of musicâ€”\\nthe Dorian style, serious, strong, even harsh. It was military music; the\\nSpartiates went into battle to the sound of the flute so that the step might\\nbe regular. Their dance was a military movement.', 'In the \"Pyrrhic\" the dancers were\\narmed and imitated all the movements of a battle; they made the gestures\\nof striking, of parrying, of retreating, and of throwing the javelin. Heroism of the Women. â€”The women stimulated the men to combat; their\\nexhibitions of courage were celebrated in Greece, so much so that\\ncollections of stories of them were made.', 'A Spartan mother, seeing her son\\nfleeing from battle, killed him with her own hand, saying; \"The Eurotas\\ndoes not flow for deer. \" Another, learning that her five sons had perished,\\nsaid, \"This is not what I wish to know; does victory belong to Sparta?\"\\n\"Yes. \" \"Then let us render thanks to the gods.', '\"\\nTHE INSTITUTIONS OF SPARTA\\nThe Kings and the Council. â€”The Spartiates had at first, like the other\\nGreeks, an assembly of the people. All these institutions were preserved,\\nbut only in form.', 'The kings, descendants of the god Herakles, were loaded\\nwith honors; they were given the first place at the feasts and were served\\nwith a double portion; when they died all the inhabitants made\\nlamentation for them. But no power was left to them and they were closely\\nwatched. The Senate was composed of twenty-eight old men taken from the rich and\\nancient families, appointed for life; but it did not govern.', 'The Ephors. â€”The real masters of Sparta were the Ephors (the name\\nsignifies overseers), five magistrates who were renewed every year. They\\ndecided peace and war, and had judicial functions; when the king\\ncommanded the army, they accompanied him, directed the operations, and\\nsometimes made him return.', 'Usually they consulted the senators and took\\naction in harmony with them. Then they assembled the Spartiates in one\\nplace, announced to them what had been decided and asked their\\napprobation. The people without discussing the matter approved the\\naction by acclamation.', 'No one knew whether he had the right to refuse\\nassent; accustomed to obey, the Spartiate never refused. It was, therefore,\\nan aristocracy of governing families. Sparta was not a country of equality.', 'There were some men who were called Equals, but only because they were\\nequal among themselves. The others were termed Inferiors and had no part\\nin the government. The Army.', 'â€”Thanks to this rÃ©gime, the Spartiates preserved the rude\\ncustoms of mountaineers; they had no sculptors, no architects, no orators,\\nno philosophers. They had sacrificed everything to war; they became\\n\"adepts in the military art,\" and instructors of the other Greeks. They\\nintroduced two innovations especially: a better method of combat, a better\\nmethod of athletic exercise.', 'The Hoplites. â€”Before them the Greeks marched into battle in disorder; the\\nchiefs, on horseback or in a light chair, rushed ahead, the men following on\\nfoot, armed each in his own fashion, helter-skelter, incapable of acting\\ntogether or of resisting. A battle reduced itself to a series of duels and to a\\nmassacre.', 'At Sparta all the soldiers had the same arms; for defence, the\\nbreastplate covering the chest, the casque which protected the head, the\\ngreaves over the legs, the buckler held before the body. For offence the\\nsoldier had a short sword and a long lance. The man thus armed was called\\na hoplite.', 'The Spartan hoplites were drawn up in regiments, battalions,\\ncompanies, squads, almost like our armies. An officer commanded each of\\nthese groups and transmitted to his men the orders of his superior officer,\\nso that the general in chief might have the same movement executed\\nthroughout the whole army. This organization which appears so simple to\\nus was to the Greeks an astonishing novelty.', 'The Phalanx. â€”Come into the presence of the enemy, the soldiers arrange\\nthemselves in line, ordinarily eight ranks deep, each man close to his\\nneighbor, forming a compact mass which we call a Phalanx. The king, who\\ndirects the army, sacrifices a goat to the gods; if the entrails of the victim\\nare propitious, he raises a chant which all the army takes up in unison.', 'Then they advance. With rapid and measured step, to the sound of the\\nflute, with lance couched and buckler before the body, they meet the\\nenemy in dense array, overwhelm him by their mass and momentum,\\nthrow him into rout, and only check themselves to avoid breaking the\\nphalanx. So long as they remain together each is protected by his neighbor\\nand all form an impenetrable mass on which the enemy could secure no\\nhold.', 'These were rude tactics, but sufficient to overcome a disorderly\\ntroop. Isolated men could not resist such a body. The other Greeks\\nunderstood this, and all, as far as they were able, imitated the Spartans;\\neverywhere men were armed as hoplites and fought in phalanx.', 'Gymnastics. â€”To rush in orderly array on the enemy and stand the shock\\nof battle there was need of agile and robust men; every man had to be an\\nathlete. The Spartans therefore organized athletic exercises, and in this the\\nother Greeks imitated them; gymnastics became for all a national art, the\\nhighest esteemed of all the arts, the crowning feature of the great festivals.', 'In the most remote countries, in the midst of the barbarians of Gaul or of\\nthe Black Sea, a Greek city was recognized by its gymnasium. There was a\\ngreat square surrounded by porticoes or walks, usually near a spring, with\\nbaths and halls for exercise. The citizens came hither to walk and chat: it\\nwas a place of association.', 'All the young men entered the gymnasium; for\\ntwo years or less they came here every day; they learned to leap, to run, to\\nthrow the disc and the javelin, to wrestle by seizing about the waist. To\\nharden the muscles and strengthen the skin they plunged into cold water,\\ndispensed with oil for the body, and rubbed the flesh with a scraper (the\\nstrigil). Athletes.', 'â€”Many continued these exercises all their lives as a point of\\nhonor and became Athletes. Some became marvels of skill. Milo of Croton\\nin Italy, it was said, would carry a bull on his shoulders; he stopped a\\nchariot in its course by seizing it from behind.', 'These athletes served\\nsometimes in combats as soldiers, or as generals. Gymnastics were the\\nschool of war. RÃ´le of the Spartiates.', 'â€”The Spartans taught the other Greeks to exercise\\nand to fight. They always remained the most vigorous wrestlers and the\\nbest soldiers, and were recognized as such by the rest of Greece. Everywhere they were respected.', 'When the rest of the Greeks had to fight\\ntogether against the Persians, they unhesitatingly took the Spartans as\\nchiefsâ€”and with justice, said an Athenian orator. CHAPTER XII\\nATHENS\\nTHE ATHENIAN PEOPLE\\nAttica. â€”The Athenians boasted of having always lived in the same\\ncountry; their ancestors, according to their story, originated from the soil\\nitself.', 'The mountaineers who conquered the south land passed by the\\ncountry without invading it; Attica was hardly a temptation to them. Attica is composed of a mass of rocks which in the form of a triangle\\nadvances into the sea. These rocks, renowned for their blocks of marble and\\nfor the honey of their bees, are bare and sterile.', 'Between them and the sea\\nare left three small plains with meagre soil, meanly watered (the streams\\nare dry in summer) and incapable of supporting a numerous population. Athens. â€”In the largest of these plains, a league from the sea, rises a\\nmassive isolated rock: Athens was built at its foot.', 'The old city, called the\\nAcropolis, occupied the summit of the rock. The inhabitants of Attica commenced, not by forming a single state, but by\\nfounding scattered villages, each of which had its own king and its own\\ngovernment. Later all these villages united under one king, the king of\\nAthens, and established a single city.', 'This does not mean that all the people\\ncame to dwell in one town. They continued to have their own villages and\\nto cultivate their lands; but all adored one and the same protecting\\ngoddess, Athena, divinity of Athens, and all obeyed the same king. Athenian Revolutions.', 'â€”Later still the kings were suppressed. In their\\nplace Athens had nine chiefs (the archons) who changed every year. This\\nwhole history is little known to us for no writing of the time is preserved.', 'They used to say that for centuries the Athenians had lived in discord; the\\nnobles (Eupatrids) who were proprietors of the soil oppressed the peasants\\non their estates; creditors held their debtors as slaves. To reÃ«stablish order\\nthe Athenians commissioned Solon, a sage, to draft a code of laws for them\\n(594). Solon made three reforms:\\n1.', 'He lessened the value of the money, which allowed the debtors to release\\nthemselves more easily. 2. He made the peasants proprietors of the land that they cultivated.', 'From\\nthis time there were in Attica more small proprietors than in any other part\\nof Greece. 3. He grouped all the citizens into four classes according to their incomes.', 'Each had to pay taxes and to render military service according to his\\nwealth, the poor being exempt from taxation and military service. After Solon the Athenians were subject to Pisistratus, one of their powerful\\nand clever citizens; but in 510 the dissensions revived. Reforms of Cleisthenes.', 'â€”Cleisthenes, leader of one of the parties, used the\\noccasion to make a thoroughgoing revolution. There were many strangers in Athens, especially seamen and traders who\\nlived in PirÃ¦us near the harbor. Cleisthenes gave them the rights of\\ncitizenship and made them equal to the older inhabitants.', 'From this time\\nthere were two populations side by sideâ€”the people of Attica and those of\\nPirÃ¦us. A difference of physical features was apparent for three centuries\\nafterward: the people of Attica resembled the rest of the Greeks; those in\\nPirÃ¦us resembled Asiatics. The Athenian people thus augmented was a\\nnew people, the most active in Greece.', 'THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE\\nIn the fifth century the society of Athens was definitely formed: three\\nclasses inhabited the district of Atticaâ€”slaves, foreigners, and citizens. The Slaves. â€”The slaves constituted the great majority of the population;\\nthere was no man so poor that he did not have at least one slave; the rich\\nowned a multitude of them, some as many as five hundred.', 'The larger part\\nof the slaves lived in the house occupied with grinding grain, kneading\\nbread, spinning and weaving cloth, performing the service of the kitchens,\\nand in attendance on their masters. Others labored in the shops as\\nblacksmiths, as dyers, or in stone quarries or silver mines. Their master fed\\nthem but sold at a profit everything which they produced, giving them in\\nreturn nothing but their living.', 'All the domestic servants, all the miners,\\nand the greater part of the artisans were slaves. These men lived in society\\nbut without any part in it; they had not even the disposition of their own\\nbodies, being wholly the property of other men. They were thought of only\\nas objects of property; they were often referred to as \"a body\" (ÏƒÏ‰Î¼Î±).', \"There\\nwas no other law for them than the will of their master, and he had all\\npower over themâ€”to make them work, to imprison them, to deprive them\\nof their sustenance, to beat them. When a citizen went to law, his adversary\\nhad the right to require that the former's slaves should be put to the torture\\nto tell what they knew. Many Athenian orators commend this usage as an\\ningenious means for obtaining true testimony.\", '\"Torture,\" says the orator\\nIsÃ¦us, \"is the surest means of proof; and so when you wish to clear up a\\ncontested question, you do not address yourselves to freemen, but, placing\\nthe slaves to the torture, you seek to discover the truth. \"\\nForeigners. â€”The name Metics was applied to people of foreign origin who\\nwere established in Athens.', 'To become a citizen of Athens it was not\\nenough, as with us, to be born in the country; one must be the son of a\\ncitizen. It might be that some aliens had resided in Attica for several\\ngenerations and yet their family not become Athenian. The metics could\\ntake no part in the government, could not marry a citizen, nor acquire land.', 'But they were personally free, they had the right of commerce by sea, of\\nbanking and of trade on condition that they take a patron to represent them\\nin the courts. There were in Athens more than ten thousand families of\\nmetics, the majority of them bankers or merchants. The Citizens.', 'â€”To be a citizen of Athens it was necessary that both parents\\nshould be citizens. The young Athenian, come to maturity at about\\neighteen years of age, appeared before the popular assembly, received the\\narms which he was to bear and took the following oath: \"I swear never to\\ndishonor these sacred arms, not to quit my post, to obey the magistrates\\nand the laws, to honor the religion of my country. \" He became\\nsimultaneously citizen and soldier.', 'Thereafter he owed military service\\nuntil he was sixty years of age. With this he had the right to sit in the\\nassembly and to fulfil the functions of the state. Once in a while the Athenians consented to receive into the citizenship a\\nman who was not the son of a citizen, but this was rare and a sign of great\\nfavor.', 'The assembly had to vote the stranger into its membership, and then\\nnine days after six thousand citizens had to vote for him on a secret ballot. The Athenian people was like a closed circle; no new members were\\nadmitted except those pleasing to the old members, and they admitted few\\nbeside their sons. THE GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS\\nThe Assembly.', 'â€”The Athenians called their government a democracy (a\\ngovernment by the people). But this people was not, as with us, the mass of\\ninhabitants, but the body of citizens, a true aristocracy of 15,000 to 20,000\\nmen who governed the whole nation as masters. This body had absolute\\npower, and was the true sovereign of Athens.', 'It assembled at least three\\ntimes a month to deliberate and to vote. The assembly was held in the open\\nair on the Pnyx; the citizens sat on stone benches arranged in an\\namphitheatre; the magistrates before them on a platform opened the\\nsession with a religious ceremony and a prayer, then a herald proclaimed\\nin a loud voice the business which was to occupy the assembly, and said,\\n\"Who wishes to speak?\" Every citizen had the right to this privilege; the\\norators mounted the tribune according to age. When all had spoken, the\\npresident put the question; the assembly voted by a show of hands, and\\nthen dissolved.', 'The Courts. â€”The people itself, being sovereign, passed judgment in the\\ncourts. Every citizen of thirty years of age could participate in the judicial\\nassembly (the HeliÃ¦a).', 'The heliasts sat in the great halls in sections of five\\nhundred; the tribunal was, then, composed of one thousand to fifteen\\nhundred judges. The Athenians had no prosecuting officer as we have; a\\ncitizen took upon himself to make the accusation. The accused and the\\naccuser appeared before the court; each delivered a plea which was not to\\nexceed the time marked off by a water-clock.', 'Then the judges voted by\\ndepositing a black or white stone. If the accuser did not obtain a certain\\nnumber of votes, he himself was condemned. The Magistrates.', 'â€”The sovereign people needed a council to prepare the\\nbusiness for discussion and magistrates to execute their decisions. The\\ncouncil was composed of five hundred citizens drawn by lot for one year. The magistrates were very numerous: ten generals to command the army,\\nthirty officials for financial administration, sixty police officials to\\nsuperintend the streets, the markets, weights and measures, etc.', 'Character of This Government. â€”The power in Athens did not pertain to\\nthe rich and the noble, as in Sparta. In the assembly everything was\\ndecided by a majority of votes and all the votes were equal.', 'All the jurors,\\nall the members of the council, all the magistrates except the generals were\\nchosen by lot. The citizens were equal not only in theory, but also in\\npractice. Socrates said to a well-informed Athenian who did not dare to\\nspeak before the people: \"Of what are you afraid? Is it of the fullers, the\\nshoe-makers, the masons, the artisans, or the merchants? for the assembly\\nis composed of all these people.', '\"\\nMany of these people had to ply their trade in order to make a living, and\\ncould not serve the state gratuitously; and so a salary was instituted: every\\ncitizen who sat in the assembly or in the courts received for every day of\\nsession three obols (about eight cents of our money), a sum just sufficient to\\nmaintain life at that time. From this day the poor administered the\\ngovernment. The Demagogues.', 'â€”Since all important affairs whether in the assembly or\\nin the courts were decided by discussion and discourse, the influential men\\nwere those who knew how to speak best. The people accustomed\\nthemselves to listen to the orators, to follow their counsels, to charge them\\nwith embassies, and even to appoint them generals. These men were called\\nDemagogues (leaders of the people).', 'The party of the rich scoffed at them:\\nin a comedy Aristophanes represents the people (Demos) under the form of\\nan old man who has lost his wits: \"You are foolishly credulous, you let\\nflatterers and intriguers pull you around by the nose and you are\\nenraptured when they harangue you. \" And the chorus, addressing a\\ncharlatan, says to him, \"You are rude, vicious; you have a strong voice, an\\nimpudent eloquence, and violent gestures; believe me, you have all that is\\nnecessary to govern Athens. \"\\nPRIVATE LIFE\\nThe Athenians created so many political functions that a part of the citizens\\nwas engaged in fulfilling them.', 'The citizen of Athens, like the functionary\\nor soldier of our days, was absorbed in public affairs. Warring and\\ngoverning were the whole of his life. He spent his days in the assembly, in\\nthe courts, in the army, at the gymnasium, or at the market.', 'Almost always\\nhe had a wife and children, for his religion commanded this, but he did not\\nlive at home. The Children. â€”When a child came into the world, the father had the right\\nto reject it.', 'In this case it was laid outside the house where it died from\\nneglect, unless a passer-by took it and brought it up as a slave. In this\\ncustom Athens followed all the Greeks. It was especially the girls that were\\nexposed to death.', '\"A son,\" says a writer of comedy, \"is always raised even\\nif the parents are in the last stage of misery; a daughter is exposed even\\nthough the parents are rich. \"\\nIf the father accepted the child, the latter entered the family. He was left at\\nfirst in the women\\'s apartments with the mother.', 'The girls remained there\\nuntil the day of their marriage; the boys came out when they were seven\\nyears old. The boy was then entrusted to a preceptor (pedagogue), whose\\nbusiness it was to teach him to conduct himself well and to obey. The\\npedagogue was often a slave, but the father gave him the right to beat his\\nson.', 'This was the general usage in antiquity. Later the boy went to school, where he learned to read, write, cipher, recite\\npoetry, and to sing in the chorus or to the sound of the flute. At last came\\ngymnastics.', 'This was the whole of the instruction; it made men sound in\\nbody and calm in spiritâ€”what the Greeks called \"good and beautiful. \"\\nTo the young girl, secluded with her mother, nothing of the liberal arts was\\ntaught; it was thought sufficient if she learned to obey. Xenophon\\nrepresents a rich and well-educated Athenian speaking thus of his wife\\nwith Socrates: \"She was hardly twenty years old when I married her, and\\nup to that time she had been subjected to an exacting surveillance; they had\\nno desire that she should live, and she learned almost nothing.', 'Was it not\\nenough that one should find in her a woman who could spin the flax to\\nmake garments, and who had learned how to distribute duties to the\\nslaves?\" When her husband proposed that she become his assistant, she\\nreplied with great surprise, \"In what can I aid you? Of what am I capable?\\nMy mother has always taught me that my business was to be prudent. \"\\nPrudence or obedience was the virtue which was required of the Greek\\nwoman. Marriage.', 'â€”At the age of fifteen the girl married. The parents had chosen\\nthe husband; it might be a man from a neighboring family, or a man who\\nhad been a long-time friend of the father, but always a citizen of Athens. It\\nwas rare that the young girl knew him; she was never consulted in the case.', 'Herodotus, speaking of a Greek, adds: \"This Callias deserves mention for\\nhis conduct toward his daughters; for when they were of marriageable age\\nhe gave them a rich dowry, permitted them to choose husbands from all\\nthe people, and he then married them to the men of their choice. \"\\nAthenian Women. â€”In the inner recess of the Athenian house there was a\\nretired apartment reserved for the womenâ€”the GynecÃ¦um.', 'Husband and\\nrelatives were the only visitors; the mistress of the household remained\\nhere all day with her slaves; she directed them, superintended the housekeeping, and distributed to them the flax for them to spin. She herself was\\nengaged with weaving garments. She left the house seldom save for the\\nreligious festivals.', 'She never appeared in the society of men: \"No one\\ncertainly would venture,\" says the orator IsÃ¦us, \"to dine with a married\\nwoman; married women do not go out to dine with men or permit\\nthemselves to eat with strangers. \" An Athenian woman who frequented\\nsociety could not maintain a good reputation. The wife, thus secluded and ignorant, was not an agreeable companion.', 'The husband had taken her not for his life-long companion, but to keep his\\nhouse in order, to be the mother of his children, and because Greek custom\\nand religion required that he should marry. Plato says that one does not\\nmarry because he wants to, but \"because the law constrains him. \" And the\\ncomic poet Menander had found this saying: \"Marriage, to tell the truth, is\\nan evil, but a necessary evil.', '\" And so the women in Athens, as in most of\\nthe other states of Greece, always held but little place in society. CHAPTER XIII\\nWARS OF THE GREEKS\\nTHE PERSIAN WARS\\nOrigin of the Persian Wars. â€”While the Greeks were completing the\\norganization of their cities, the Persian king was uniting all the nations of\\nthe East in a single empire.', 'Greeks and Orientals at length found\\nthemselves face to face. It is in Asia Minor that they first meet. On the coast of Asia Minor there were rich and populous colonies of the\\nGreeks; Cyrus, the king of Persia, desired to subject them.', 'These cities sent\\nfor help to the Spartans, who were reputed the bravest of the Greeks, and\\nthis action was reported to Cyrus; he replied, \"I have never feared this sort\\nof people that has in the midst of the city a place where the people\\nassemble to deceive one another with false oaths. \" (He was thinking of the\\nmarket-place. ) The Greeks of Asia were subdued and made subject to the\\nGreat King.', 'Thirty years later King Darius found himself in the presence of the Greeks\\nof Europe. But this time it was the Greeks that attacked the Great King. The\\nAthenians sent twenty galleys to aid the revolting Ionians; their soldiers\\nentered Lydia, took Sardis by surprise and burned it.', 'Darius revenged\\nhimself by destroying the Greek cities of Asia, but he did not forget the\\nGreeks of Europe. He had decreed, they say, that at every meal an officer\\nshould repeat to him: \"Master, remember the Athenians. \" He sent to the\\nGreek cities to demand earth and water, a symbol in use among the\\nPersians to indicate submission to the Great King.', 'Most of the Greeks were\\nafraid and yielded. But the Spartans cast the envoys into a pit, bidding\\nthem take thence earth and water to carry to the king. This was the\\nbeginning of the Median wars.', 'Comparison of the Two Adversaries. â€”The contrast between the two\\nworlds which now entered into conflict is well marked by Herodotus in the\\nform of a conversation of King Xerxes with Demaratus, a Spartan exile: \"\\'I\\nventure to assure you,\\' said Demaratus, \\'that the Spartans will offer you\\nbattle even if all the rest of the Greeks fight on your side, and if their army\\nshould not amount to more than one thousand men. \\' \\'What!\\' said Xerxes,\\n\\'one thousand men attack so immense an army as mine! I fear your words\\nare only boasting; for although they be five thousand, we are more than\\none thousand to one.', \"If they had a master like us, fear would inspire them\\nwith courage; they would march under the lash against a larger army; but\\nbeing free and independent, they will have no more courage than that with\\nwhich nature has endowed them. ' 'The Spartans,' replied Demaratus, 'are\\nnot inferior to anybody in a hand-to-hand contest, and united in a phalanx\\nthey are the bravest of all men. Yet, though free, they have an absolute\\nmaster, the Law, which they dread more than all your subjects do you; they\\nobey it, and this law requires them to stand fast to their post and conquer\\nor die.\", '\\'\" This is the difference between the two parties to the conflict: on the\\none side, a multitude of subjects united by force under a capricious master;\\non the other, little martial republics whose citizens govern themselves\\naccording to laws which they respect. First Persian War. â€”There were two Persian wars.', 'The first was simply an\\nexpedition against Athens; six hundred galleys sent by Darius\\ndisembarked a Persian army on the little plain of Marathon, seven hours\\ndistant from Athens. Religious sentiment prevented the Spartans from taking the field before the\\nfull moon, and it was still only the first quarter; the Athenians had to fight\\nalone. Ten thousand citizens armed as hoplites camped before the Persians.', 'The Athenians had ten generals, having the command on successive days;\\nof these Miltiades, when his turn came, drew up the army for battle. The\\nAthenians charged the enemy in serried ranks, but the Persians seeing\\nthem advancing without cavalry and without archers, thought them fools. It was the first time that the Greeks had dared to face the Persians in battle\\narray.', 'The Athenians began by turning both flanks, and then engaged the\\ncentre, driving the Persians in disorder to the sea and forcing them to\\nreÃ«mbark on their ships. The victory of Marathon delivered the Athenians and made them famous\\nin all Greece (490). Second Persian War.', 'â€”The second war began ten years later with an\\ninvasion. Xerxes united all the peoples of the empire, so that the land force\\namounted, as some say, to 1,700,000 men. There were Medes and Persians\\nclad in sleeved tunics, armed with cuirasses of iron, bucklers, bows and\\narrows; Assyrians with cuirass of linen, armed with clubs pointed with\\niron; Indians clad in cotton with bows and arrows of bamboo; savages of\\nEthiopia with leopard skins for clothing; nomads armed only with lassos;\\nPhrygians armed with short pikes; Lydians equipped like Greeks;\\nThracians carrying javelins and daggers.', 'The enumeration of these fills\\ntwenty chapters in Herodotus. These warriors brought with them a crowd\\nequally numerous of non-combatants, of servants, slaves, women, together\\nwith a mass of mules, horses, camels, and baggage wagons. This horde crossed the Hellespont by a bridge of boats in the spring of 480.', 'For seven days and nights it defiled under the lash. Then traversing Thrace,\\nit marched on Greece, conquering the peoples whom it met. The Persian fleet, 1,200 galleys strong, coasted the shores of Thrace, passing\\nthrough the canal at Mount Athos which Xerxes had had built for this very\\npurpose.', 'The Greeks, terrified, submitted for the most part to the Great King and\\njoined their armies to the Persian force. The Athenians sent to consult the\\noracle of Delphi, but received only the reply; \"Athens will be destroyed\\nfrom base to summit. \" The god being asked to give a more favorable\\nresponse, replied, \"Zeus accords to Pallas [protectress of Athens] a wall of\\nwood which alone shall not be taken; in that shall you and your children\\nfind safety.', '\" The priests of whom they asked the interpretation of this\\noracle bade the Athenians quit Attica and go to establish themselves\\nelsewhere. But Themistocles explained the \"wall of wood\" as meaning the\\nships; they should retire to the fleet and fight the Persians on sea. Athens and Sparta, having decided on resistance, endeavored to form a\\nleague of the Greeks against the Persians.', 'Few cities had the courage to\\nenter it, and these placed themselves under the command of the Spartans. Four battles in one year settled the war. At ThermopylÃ¦, Leonidas, king of\\nSparta, who tried to bar the entrance to a defile was outflanked and\\noverwhelmed.', 'At Salamis, the Persian fleet, crowded into a narrow space\\nwhere the ships embarrassed one another, was defeated by the Greek navy\\n(480). At PlatÃ¦a the rest of the Persian army left in Greece was annihilated\\nby the Greek hoplites; of 300,000 men but 40,000 escaped. The same day at\\nMycale, on the coast of Asia, an army of the Greeks landed and routed the\\nPersians (479).', 'The Greeks had conquered the Great King. Reasons for the Greek Victory. â€”The Median war was not a national war\\nbetween Greeks and barbarians.', 'All the Greeks of Asia and half the Greeks\\nof Europe fought on the Persian side. Many of the other Greeks gave no\\nassistance. In reality it was a fight of the Great King and his subjects against\\nSparta, Athens, and their allies.', 'The conquest of this great horde by two small peoples appeared at that\\ntime as a prodigy. The gods, said the Greeks, had fought for them. But\\nthere is less wonder when we examine the two antagonists more closely:\\nthe Persian army was innumerable, and Xerxes had thought that victory\\nwas a matter of numbers.', 'But this multitude was an embarrassment to\\nitself. It did not know where to secure food for itself, it advanced but\\nslowly, and it choked itself on the day of combat. Likewise the ships\\narranged in too close order drove their prows into neighboring ships and\\nshattered their oars.', 'Then in this immense crowd there were, according to\\nHerodotus, many men but few soldiers. Only the Persians and Medes, the\\nflower of the army, fought with energy; the rest advanced only under the\\nlash, they had come under pressure to a war which had no interest for\\nthem, ill-armed and without discipline, ready to desert as soon as no one\\nwas watching them. At PlatÃ¦a the Medes and Persians were the only ones\\nto do any fighting; the subjects kept aloof.', 'The Persian soldiers were ill-equipped; they were embarrassed by their\\nlong robes, the head was poorly protected by a felt hat, the body illdefended by a shield of wicker-work. For arms they had a bow, a dagger,\\nand a very short pike; they could fight only at a great distance or hand-tohand. The Spartans and their allies, on the contrary, secure in the\\nprotection of great buckler, helmet and greaves, marched in solid line and\\nwere irresistible; they broke the enemy with their long pikes and at once\\nthe battle became a massacre.', 'Results of the Persian Wars. â€”Sparta had commanded the troops, but as\\nHerodotus says, it was Athens who had delivered Greece by setting an\\nexample of resistance and constituting the fleet of Salamis. It was Athens\\nwho profited by the victory.', 'All the Ionian cities of the Archipelago and of\\nthe coast of Asia revolted and formed a league against the Persians. The\\nSpartans, men of the mountains, could not conduct a maritime war, and so\\nwithdrew; the Athenians immediately became chiefs of the league. In 476\\nAristides, commanding the fleet, assembled the delegates of the\\nconfederate cities.', 'They decided to continue the war against the Great\\nKing, and engaged to provide ships and warriors and to pay each year a\\ncontribution of 460 talents ($350,000). The treasure was deposited at Delos\\nin the temple of Apollo, god of the Ionians. Athens was charged with the\\nleadership of the military force and with collecting the tax.', 'To make the\\nagreement irrevocable Aristides had a mass of hot iron cast into the sea,\\nand all swore to maintain the oaths until the day that the iron should\\nmount to the surface. A day came, however, when the war ceased, and the Greeks, always the\\nvictors, concluded a peace, or at least a truce, with the Great King. He\\nsurrendered his claim on the Asiatic Greeks (about 449).', 'What was to become of the treaty of Aristides? Were the confederate cities\\nstill to pay their contribution now that there was no more fighting? Some\\nrefused it even before the war was done. Athens asserted that the cities had\\nmade their engagements in perpetuity and forced them to pay them. The war finished, the treasury at Delos had no further use; the Athenians\\ntransferred the money to Athens and used it in building their monuments.', 'They maintained that the allies paid for deliverance from the Persians;\\nthey, therefore, had no claim against Athens so long as she defended them\\nfrom the Great King. The allies had now become the tributaries of Athens:\\nthey were now her subjects. Athens increased the tax on them, and\\nrequired their citizens to bring their cases before the Athenian courts; she\\neven sent colonists to seize a part of their lands.', 'Athens, mistress of the\\nleague, was sovereign over more than three hundred cities spread over the\\nislands and the coasts of the Archipelago, and the tribute paid her\\namounted to six hundred talents a year. STRIFE AMONG THE GREEK STATES\\nThe Peloponnesian War. â€”After the foundation of the Athenian empire in\\nthe Archipelago the Greeks found themselves divided between two\\nleaguesâ€”the maritime cities were subject to Athens; the cities of the\\ninterior remained under the domination of Sparta.', 'After much preliminary\\nfriction war arose between Sparta and her continental allies on the one side\\nand Athens and her maritime subjects on the other. This was\\nthePeloponnesian War. It continued twenty-seven years (431-404), and\\nwhen it ceased, it was revived under other names down to 360.', 'These wars were complicated affairs. They were fought simultaneously on\\nland and sea, in Greece, Asia, Thrace, and Sicily, ordinarily at several\\npoints at once. The Spartans had a better army and ravaged Attica; the\\nAthenians had a superior fleet and made descents on the coasts of the\\nPeloponnesus.', 'Then Athens sent its army to Sicily where it perished to the\\nlast man (413); Lysander, a Spartan general, secured a fleet from the\\nPersians and destroyed the Athenian fleet in Asia (405). The Athenian allies\\nwho fought only under compulsion abandoned her. Lysander took Athens,\\ndemolished its walls, and burnt its ships.', 'Wars against Sparta. â€”Sparta was for a time mistress on both land and sea. \"In those days,\" says Xenophon, \"all cities obeyed when a Spartan issued\\nhis orders.', '\" But soon the allies of Sparta, wearied of her domination,\\nformed a league against her. The Spartans, driven at first from Asia, still\\nmaintained their power in Greece for some years by virtue of their alliance\\nwith the king of the Persians (387). But the Thebans, having developed a\\nstrong army under the command of Epaminondas, fought them at Leuctra\\n(371) and at Mantinea (362).', 'The allies of Sparta detached themselves from\\nher, but the Thebans could not secure from the rest of the Greeks the\\nrecognition of their supremacy. From this time no Greek city was sovereign\\nover the others. Savage Character of These Wars.', 'â€”These wars between the Greek cities\\nwere ferocious. A few incidents suffice to show their character. At the\\nopening of the war the allies of Sparta threw into the sea all the merchants\\nfrom cities hostile to them.', 'The Athenians in return put to death the\\nambassadors of Sparta without allowing them to speak a word. The town\\nof PlatÃ¦a was taken by capitulation, and the Spartans had promised that\\nno one should be punished without a trial; but the Spartan judges\\ndemanded of every prisoner if during the war he had rendered any service\\nto the Peloponnesians; when the prisoner replied in the negative, he was\\ncondemned to death. The women were sold as slaves.', 'The city of Mitylene\\nhaving revolted from Athens was retaken by her. The Athenians in an\\nassembly deliberated and decreed that all the people of Mitylene should be\\nput to death. It is true that the next day the Athenians revised the decree\\nand sent a second ship to carry a more favorable commission, but still more\\nthan one thousand Mityleneans were executed.', 'After the Syracusan disaster all the Athenian army was taken captive. The\\nconquerors began by slaughtering all the generals and many of the\\nsoldiers. The remainder were consigned to the quarries which served as\\nprison.', 'They were left there crowded together for seventy days, exposed\\nwithout protection to the burning sun of summer, and then to the chilly\\nnights of autumn. Many died from sickness, from cold and hungerâ€”for\\nthey were hardly fed at all; their corpses remained on the ground and\\ninfected the air. At last the Syracusans drew out the survivors sold them\\ninto slavery.', 'Ordinarily when an army invaded a hostile state it levelled the houses,\\nfelled the trees, burned the crops and killed the laborers. After battle it\\nmade short shrift of the wounded and killed prisoners in cold blood. In a\\ncaptured city everything belonged to the captor: men, women, children\\nwere sold as slaves.', 'Such was at this time the right of war. Thucydides\\nsums up the case as follows: \"Business is regulated between men by the\\nlaws of justice when there is obligation on both sides; but the stronger does\\nwhatever is in his power, and the weaker yields. The gods rule by a\\nnecessity of their nature because they are strongest; men do likewise.', '\"\\nResults of These Wars. â€”These wars did not result in uniting the Greeks\\ninto one body. No city, Sparta more than Athens, was able to force the\\nothers to obey her.', 'They only exhausted themselves by fighting one\\nanother. It was the king of Persia who profited by the strife. Not only did\\nthe Greek cities not unite against him, but all in succession allied\\nthemselves with him against the other Greeks.', 'In the notorious Peace of\\nAntalcidas (387) the Great King declared that all the Greek cities of Asia\\nbelonged to him, and Sparta recognized this claim. Athens and Thebes did\\nas much some years later. An Athenian orator said, \"It is the king of Persia\\nwho governs Greece; he needs only to establish governors in our cities.', 'Is it\\nnot he who directs everything among us? Do we not summon the Great\\nKing as if we were his slaves?\" The Greeks by their strife had lost the\\nvantage that the Median war had gained for them. CHAPTER XIV\\nTHE ARTS IN GREECE\\nATHENS AT THE TIME OF PERICLES\\nPericles. â€”In the middle of the fifth century Athens found herself the most\\npowerful city in Greece.', 'Pericles, descended from one of the noble families,\\nwas then the director of the affairs of the state. He wasted neither speech\\nnor personality, and never sought to flatter the vanity of the people. But the\\nAthenians respected him and acted only in accordance with his counsels;\\nthey had faith in his knowledge of all the details of administration, of the\\nresources of the state, and so they permitted him to govern.', 'For forty years\\nPericles was the soul of the politics of Athens; as Thucydides his\\ncontemporary said, \"The democracy existed in name; in reality it was the\\ngovernment of the first citizen. \"\\nAthens and Her Monuments. â€”In Athens, as in the majority of Greek cities,\\nthe houses of individuals were small, low, packed closely together, forming\\nnarrow streets, tortuous and ill paved.', 'The Athenians reserved their\\ndisplay for their public monuments. Ever after they levied heavy war taxes\\non their allies they had large sums of money to expend, and these were\\nemployed in erecting beautiful edifices. In the market-place they built a\\nportico adorned with paintings (the Poikile), in the city a theatre, a temple\\nin honor of Theseus, and the Odeon for the contests in music.', 'But the most\\nbeautiful monuments rose on the rock of the Acropolis as on a gigantic\\npedestal. There were two temples of which the principal, the Parthenon,\\nwas dedicated to Athena, protecting goddess of the city; a colossal statue of\\nbronze which represented Athena; and a staircase of ornamental character\\nleading up to the PropylÃ¦a. Athens was from this time the most beautiful\\nof the Greek cities.', 'Importance of Athens. â€”Athens became at the same time the city of artists. Poets, orators, architects, painters, sculptorsâ€”some Athenians by birth,\\nothers come from all corners of the Greek worldâ€”met here and produced\\ntheir masterpieces.', 'There were without doubt many Greek artists\\nelsewhere than at Athens; there had been before the fifth century, and there\\nwere a long time afterward; but never were so many assembled at one time\\nin the same city. Most of the Greeks had fine sensibilities in matters of art;\\nbut the Athenians more than all others had a refined taste, a cultivated\\nspirit and love of the beautiful. If the Greeks have gained renown in the\\nhistory of civilization, it is that they have been a people of artists; neither\\ntheir little states nor their small armies have played a great rÃ´le in the\\nworld.', 'This is why the fifth century is the most beautiful moment in the\\nhistory of Greece; this is why Athens has remained renowned above all the\\nrest of the Greek cities. LETTERS\\nThe Orators. â€”Athens is above all the city of eloquence.', 'Speeches in the\\nassembly determine war, peace, taxes, all state business of importance;\\nspeeches before the courts condemn or acquit citizens and subjects. Power\\nis in the hands of the orators; the people follow their counsels and often\\ncommit to them important public functions: Cleon is appointed general;\\nDemosthenes directs the war against Philip. The orators have influence; they employ their talents in eloquence to accuse\\ntheir political enemies.', 'Often they possess riches, for they are paid for\\nsupporting one party or the other: Ã†schines is retained by the king of\\nMacedon; Demosthenes accepts fees from the king of Persia. Some of the orators, instead of delivering their own orations, wrote\\nspeeches for others. When an Athenian citizen had a case at court, he did\\nnot desire, as we do, that an advocate plead his case for him; the law\\nrequired that each speak in person.', 'He therefore sought an orator and had\\nhim compose a speech which he learned by heart and recited before the\\ntribunal. Other orators travelled through the cities of Greece speaking on subjects\\nwhich pleased their fancy. Sometimes they gave lectures, as we should say.', 'The oldest orators spoke simply, limiting themselves to an account of the\\nfacts without oratorical flourishes; on the platform they were almost rigid\\nwithout loud speaking or gesticulation. Pericles delivered his orations with\\na calm air, so quietly, indeed, that no fold of his mantle was disturbed. When he appeared at the tribune, his head, according to custom, crowned\\nwith leaves, he might have been taken, said the people, \"for a god of\\nOlympus.', '\" But the orators who followed wished to move the public. They\\nassumed an animated style, pacing the tribune in a declamatory and\\nagitated manner. The people became accustomed to this form of eloquence.', 'The first time that Demosthenes came to the tribune the assembly shouted\\nwith laughter; the orator could not enunciate, he carried himself ill. He\\ndisciplined himself in declamation and gesture and became the favorite of\\nthe people. Later when he was asked what was the first quality of the\\norator, he replied, \"Action, and the second, action, and the third, action.', '\"\\nAction, that is delivery, was more to the Greeks than the sense of the\\ndiscourse. The Sages. â€”For some centuries there had been, especially among the\\nGreeks of Asia, men who observed and reflected on things.', 'They were\\ncalled by a name which signifies at once wise men and scholars. They\\nbusied themselves with physics, astronomy, natural history, for as yet\\nscience was not separated from philosophy. Such were in the seventh\\ncentury the celebrated Seven Sages of Greece.', 'The Sophists. â€”About the time of Pericles there came to Athens men who\\nprofessed to teach wisdom. They gathered many pupils and charged fees\\nfor their lessons.', 'Ordinarily they attacked the religion, customs, and\\ninstitutions of Greek cities, showing that they were not founded on reason. They concluded that men could not know anything with certainty (which\\nwas quite true for their time), that men can know nothing at all, and that\\nnothing is true or false: \"Nothing exists,\" said one of them, \"and if it did\\nexist, we could not know it. \" These professors of scepticism were called\\nsophists.', 'Some of them were at the same time orators. Socrates and the Philosophers. â€”Socrates, an old man of Athens, undertook\\nto combat the sophists.', 'He was a poor man, ugly, and without eloquence. He opened no school like the sophists but contented himself with going\\nabout the city, conversing with those he met, and leading them by the force\\nof his questions to discover what he himself had in mind. He sought\\nespecially the young men and gave them instruction and counsel.', 'Socrates\\nmade no pretensions as a scholar: \"All my knowledge,\" said he, \"is to know\\nthat I know nothing. \" He would call himself no longer a sage, like the\\nothers, but a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom. He did not\\nmeditate on the nature of the world nor on the sciences; man was his only\\ninterest.', 'His motto was, \"Know thyself. \" He was before all a preacher of\\nvirtue. As he always spoke of morals and religion, the Athenians took him for a\\nsophist.', 'In 399 he was brought before the court, accused \"of not\\nworshipping the gods of the city, of introducing new gods, and of\\ncorrupting the youth. \" He made no attempt to defend himself, and was\\ncondemned to death. He was then seventy years old.', 'Xenophon, one of his disciples, wrote out his conversations and an apology\\nfor him. Another disciple, Plato, composed dialogues in which Socrates is\\nalways the principal personage. Since this time Socrates has been regarded\\nas the \"father of philosophy.', '\" Plato himself was the head of a school (429-\\n348); Aristotle (384-322), a disciple of Plato, summarized in his books all the\\nscience of his time. The philosophers that followed attached themselves to\\none or the other of these two masters: the disciples of Plato called\\nthemselves Academicians, those of Aristotle, Peripatetics. The Chorus.', 'â€”It was an ancient custom of the Greeks to dance in their\\nreligious ceremonies. Around the altar dedicated to the god a group of\\nyoung men passed and repassed, assuming noble and expressive attitudes,\\nfor the ancients danced with the whole body. Their dance, very different\\nfrom ours, was a sort of animated procession, something like a solemn\\npantomime.', 'Almost always this religious dance was accompanied by\\nchants in honor of the god. The group singing and dancing at the same\\ntime was called the Chorus. All the cities had their festival choruses in\\nwhich the children of the noblest families participated after long time of\\npreparation.', 'The god required the service of a troop worthy of him. Tragedy and Comedy. â€”In the level country about Athens the young men\\ncelebrated in this manner each year religious dances in honor of Dionysos,\\nthe god of the vintage.', 'One of these dances was grave; it represented the\\nactions of the god. The leader of the chorus played Dionysos, the chorus\\nitself the satyrs, his companions. Little by little they came to represent also\\nthe life of the other gods and the ancient heroes.', 'Then some one (the\\nGreeks call him Thespis) conceived the idea of setting up a stage on which\\nthe actor could play while the chorus rested. The spectacle thus perfected\\nwas transferred to the city near the black poplar tree in the market. Thus\\noriginated Tragedy.', 'The other dance was comic. The masked dancers chanted the praises of\\nDionysos mingled with jeers addressed to the spectators or with humorous\\nreflections on the events of the day. The same was done for the comic\\nchorus as for the tragic chorus: actors were introduced, a dialogue, all of a\\npiece, and the spectacle was transferred to Athens.', 'This was the origin of\\nComedy. This is the reason that from this time tragedy has been engaged\\nwith heroes, and comedy with every-day life. Tragedy and comedy preserved some traces of their origin.', 'Even when\\nthey were represented in the theatre, they continued to be played before\\nthe altar of the god. Even after the actors mounted on the platform had\\nbecome the most important personages of the spectacle, the choir\\ncontinued to dance and to chant around the altar. In the comedies, like the\\nmasques in other days, sarcastic remarks on the government came to be\\nmade; this was the Parabasis.', 'The Theatre. â€”That all the Athenians might be present at these spectacles\\nthere was built on the side of the Acropolis the theatre of Dionysos which\\ncould hold 30,000 spectators. Like all the Greek theatres, it was open to\\nheaven and was composed of tiers of rock ranged in a half-circle about the\\norchestra where the chorus performed and before the stage where the play\\nwas given.', 'Plays were produced only at the time of the festivals of the god, but then\\nthey continued for several days in succession. They began in the morning\\nat sunrise and occupied all the time till torch-light with the production of a\\nseries of three tragedies (a trilogy) followed by a satirical drama. Each\\ntrilogy was the work of one author.', 'Other trilogies were presented on\\nsucceeding days, so that the spectacle was a competition between poets, the\\npublic determining the victor. The most celebrated of these competitors\\nwere Ã†schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. There were also contests in\\ncomedy, but there remain to us only the works of one comic poet,\\nAristophanes.', 'THE ARTS\\nGreek Temples. â€”In Greece the most beautiful edifices were constructed to\\nthe honor of the gods, and when we speak of Greek architecture it is their\\ntemples that we have in mind. A Greek temple is not, like a Christian church, designed to receive the\\nfaithful who come thither to pray.', 'It is the palace where the god lives,\\nrepresented by his idol, a palace which men feel under compulsion to make\\nsplendid. The mass of the faithful do not enter the interior of the temple;\\nthey remain without, surrounding the altar in the open air. At the centre of the temple is the \"chamber\" of the god, a mysterious\\nsanctuary without windows, dimly lighted from above.', 'On the pavement\\nrises the idol of wood, of marble, or of ivory, clad in gold and adorned with\\ngarments and jewels. The statue is often of colossal size; in the temple of\\nOlympia Zeus is represented sitting and his head almost touches the\\nsummit of the temple. \"If the god should rise,\" they said, \"his head would\\nshatter the roof.', '\" This sanctuary, a sort of reliquary for the idol, is\\nconcealed on every side from the eyes. To enter, it is necessary to pass\\nthrough a porch formed by a row of columns. Behind the \"chamber\" is the \"rear-chamber\" in which are kept the valuable\\nproperty of the godâ€”his riches, and often the gold and silver of the city.', 'The temple is therefore storehouse, treasury, and museum. Rows of columns surround the building on four sides, like a second wall\\nprotecting the god and his treasures. There are three orders of columns\\nwhich differ in base and capital, each bearing the name of the people that\\ninvented it or most frequently used it.', 'They are, in the order of age, the\\nDoric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian. The temple is named from the style of\\nthe columns supporting it. Above the columns, around the edifice are sculptured surfaces of marble\\n(the metopes) which alternate with plain blocks of marble (the triglyphs).', 'Metopes and triglyphs constitute the frieze. The temple is surmounted with a triangular pediment adorned with\\nstatues. Greek temples were polychrome, that is to say, were painted in several\\ncolors, yellow, blue, and red.', 'For a long time the moderns refused to\\nbelieve this; it was thought that the Greeks possessed too sober taste to add\\ncolor to an edifice. But traces of painting have been discovered on several\\ntemples, which cannot leave the matter in doubt. It has at last been\\nconcluded, on reflection, that these bright colors were to give a clearer\\nsetting to the lines.', 'Characteristics of Greek Architecture. â€”A Greek temple appears at first a\\nsimple, bare edifice; it is only a long box of stone set upon a rock; the\\nfaÃ§ade is a square surmounted by a triangle. At first glance one sees only\\nstraight lines and cylinders.', 'But on nearer inspection \"it is discovered that\\nnot a single one of these lines is truly straight. \" The columns swell at the\\nmiddle, vertical lines are slightly inclined to the centre, and horizontal lines\\nbulge a little at the middle. And all this is so fine that exact measurements\\nare necessary to detect the artifice.', 'Greek architects discovered that, to\\nproduce a harmonious whole, it is necessary to avoid geometrical lines\\nwhich would appear stiff, and take account of illusions in perspective. \"The\\naim of the architect,\" says a Greek writer, \"is to invent processes for\\ndeluding the sight. \"\\nGreek artists wrought conscientiously for they worked for the gods.', 'And so\\ntheir monuments are elaborated in all their parts, even in those that are\\nleast in view, and are constructed so solidly that they exist to this day if\\nthey have not been violently destroyed. The Parthenon was still intact in\\nthe seventeenth century. An explosion of gunpowder wrecked it.', 'The architecture of the Greeks was at once solid and elegant, simple and\\nscientific. Their temples have almost all disappeared; here and there are a\\nvery few, wholly useless, in ruins, with roofs fallen in, often nothing left\\nbut rows of columns. And yet, even in this state, they enrapture those who\\nbehold them.', 'Sculpture. â€”Among the Egyptians and the Assyrians sculpture was hardly\\nmore than an accessory ornament of their edifices; the Greeks made it the\\nprincipal art. Their most renowned artists, Phidias, Praxiteles, and\\nLysippus, were sculptors.', 'They executed bas-reliefs to adorn the walls of a temple, its faÃ§ade or its\\npediment. Of this style of work is the famous frieze of the Panathenaic\\nprocession which was carved around the Parthenon, representing young\\nAthenian women on the day of the great festival of the goddess. They sculptured statues for the most part, of which some represented gods\\nand served as idols; others represented athletes victorious in the great\\ngames, and these were the recompense of his victory.', 'The most ancient statues of the Greeks are stiff and rude, quite similar to\\nthe Assyrian sculptures. They are often colored. Little by little they become\\ngraceful and elegant.', 'The greatest works are those of Phidias in the fifth\\ncentury and of Praxiteles in the fourth. The statues of the following\\ncenturies are more graceful, but less noble and less powerful. There were thousands of statues in Greece, for every city had its own, and\\nthe sculptors produced without cessation for five centuries.', 'Of all this\\nmultitude there remain to us hardly fifteen complete statues. Not a single\\nexample of the masterpieces celebrated among the Greeks has come down\\nto us. Our most famous Greek statues are either copies, like the Venus of\\nMilo, or works of the period of the decadence, like the Apollo of the\\nBelvidere.', 'Still there remains enough, uniting the fragments of statues and\\nof bas-reliefs which are continually being discovered, to give us a general\\nconception of Greek sculpture. Greek sculptors sought above everything else to represent the most\\nbeautiful bodies in a calm and noble attitude. They had a thousand\\noccasions for viewing beautiful bodies of men in beautiful poses, at the\\ngymnasium, in the army, in the sacred dances and choruses.', 'They studied\\nthem and learned to reproduce them; no one has ever better executed the\\nhuman body. Usually in a Greek statue the head is small, the face without emotion and\\ndull. The Greeks did not seek, as we do, the expression of the face; they\\nstrove for beauty of line and did not sacrifice the limbs for the head.', 'In a\\nGreek statue it is the whole body that is beautiful. Pottery. â€”The Greeks came to make pottery a real art.', \"They called it\\nCeramics (the potter's art), and this name is still preserved. Pottery had not\\nthe same esteem in Greece as the other arts, but for us it has the great\\nadvantage of being better known than the others. While temples and\\nstatues fell into ruin, the achievements of Greek potters are preserved in\\nthe tombs.\", 'This is where they are found today. Already more than 20,000\\nspecimens have been collected in all the museums of Europe. They are of\\ntwo sorts:\\n1.', 'Painted vases, with black or red figures, of all sizes and every form;\\n2. Statuettes of baked earth; hardly known twenty years ago, they have\\nnow attained almost to celebrity since the discovery of the charming\\nfigurines of Tanagra in BÅ“otia. The most of them are little idols, but some\\nrepresent children or women.', 'Painting. â€”There were illustrious painters in Greeceâ€”Zeuxis, Parrhasius,\\nand Apelles. We know little of them beyond some anecdotes, often\\ndoubtful, and some descriptions of pictures.', 'To obtain an impression of\\nGreek painting we are limited to the frescoes found in the houses of\\nPompeii, an Italian city of the first century of our era. This amounts to the\\nsame as saying we know nothing of it. CHAPTER XV\\nTHE GREEKS IN THE ORIENT\\nASIA BEFORE ALEXANDER\\nDecadence of the Persian Empire.', 'â€”The Greeks, engaged in strife, ceased to\\nattack the Great King; they even received their orders from him. But the\\nPersian empire still continued to become enfeebled. The satraps no longer\\nobeyed the government; each had his court, his treasure, his army, made\\nwar according to his fancy, and in short, became a little king in his\\nprovince.', 'When the Great King desired to remove a satrap, he had scarcely\\nany way of doing it except by assassinating him. The Persians themselves\\nwere no longer that nation before which all the Asiatic peoples were wont\\nto tremble. Xenophon, a Greek captain, who had been in their pay,\\ndescribes them as follows: \"They recline on tapestries wearing gloves and\\nfurs.', 'The nobles, for the sake of the pay, transform their porters, their\\nbakers, and cooks into knightsâ€”even the valets who served them at table,\\ndressed them or perfumed them. And so, although their armies were large,\\nthey were of no service, as is apparent from the fact that their enemies\\ntraversed the empire more freely than their friends.

But they surrounded themselves with Greeks and founded their capital on\\nthe edge of the sea in a Greek city, Alexandria, a new city established by\\nthe order of Alexander. Built on a simple plan, Alexandria was more regular than other Greek\\ncities.', 'The streets intersected at right angles; a great highway 100 feet broad\\nand three and one-half miles in length traversed the whole length of the\\ncity. It was bordered with great monumentsâ€”the Stadium where the\\npublic games were presented, the Gymnasium, the Museum, and the\\nArsineum.

Hire himself as a farmer, an artisan, or\\na sailor? But the proprietors already had their estates, their workshops,\\ntheir merchantmen manned by slaves who served them much more\\ncheaply than free laborers, for they fed them ill and did not pay them. Could he work on his own account? But money was very scarce; he could\\nnot borrow, since interest was at the rate of ten per cent. Then, too, custom\\ndid not permit a citizen to become an artisan.', '\"Trade,\" said the\\nphilosophers, \"injures the body, enfeebles the soul and leaves no leisure to\\nengage in public affairs. \" \"And so,\" says Aristotle, \"a well-constituted city\\nought not to receive the artisan into citizenship. \" The citizens in Greece\\nconstituted a noble class whose only honorable functions, like the nobles of\\nancient France, were to govern and go to war; working with the hands was\\ndegrading.', 'Thus by the competition of slaves and their exalted situation the\\ngreater part of the citizens were reduced to extreme misery. Social Strife. â€”The poor governed the cities and had no means of living.', 'The idea occurred to them to despoil the rich, and the latter, to resist them,\\norganized associations. Then every Greek city was divided into two\\nparties: the rich, called the minority, and the poor, called the majority or\\nthe people. Rich and poor hated one another and fought one another.', 'When the poor got the upper hand, they exiled the rich and confiscated\\ntheir goods; often they even adopted these two radical measures:\\n1. The abolition of debts;\\n2. A new partition of lands.', 'The rich, when they returned to power, exiled the poor. In many cities they\\ntook this oath among themselves: \"I swear always to be an enemy to the\\npeople and to do them all the injury I can. \"\\nNo means were found of reconciling the two parties: the rich could not\\npersuade themselves to surrender their property; the poor were unwilling\\nto die of hunger.', 'According to Aristotle all revolutions have their origin in\\nthe distribution of wealth. \"Every civil war,\" says Polybius, \"is initiated to\\nsubvert wealth. \"\\nThey fought savagely, as is always the case between neighbors.', '\"At Miletus\\nthe poor were at first predominant and forced the rich to flee the city. But\\nafterwards, regretting that they had not killed them all, they took the\\nchildren of the exiles, assembled them in barns and had them trodden\\nunder the feet of cattle. The rich reÃ«ntered the city and became masters of\\nit.', 'In their turn they seized the children of the poor, coated them with pitch,\\nand burned them alive. \"\\nDemocracy and Oligarchy. â€”Each of the two partiesâ€”rich and poorâ€”had\\nits favorite form of government and set it in operation when the party held\\nthe city.', 'The party of the rich was the Oligarchy which gave the\\ngovernment into the hands of a few people. That of the poor was the\\nDemocracy which gave the power to an assembly of the people. Each of the\\ntwo parties maintained an understanding with the similar party in the\\nother cities.', 'Thus were formed two leagues which divided all the Greek\\ncities: the league of the rich, or Oligarchy, the league of the poor, or\\nDemocracy. This rÃ©gime began during the Peloponnesian War. Athens\\nsupported the democratic party, Sparta the oligarchic.', 'The cities in which\\nthe poor had the sovereignty allied themselves with Athens; the cities\\nwhere the rich governed, with Sparta. Thus at Samos when the poor gained\\nsupremacy they slew two hundred of the rich, exiled four hundred of\\nthem, and confiscated their lands and houses. Samos then adopted a\\ndemocratic government and allied itself with Athens.', 'The Spartan army\\ncame to besiege Samos, bringing with it the rich exiles of Samos who\\nwished to return to the city by force. The city was captured, set up an\\noligarchy, and joined the league of Sparta. The Tyrants.', 'â€”At length, the poor perceived that the democratic form of\\ngovernment did not give them strength enough to maintain the contest. In\\nmost of the cities they consented to receive a chief. This chief was called\\nTyrant.', 'He governed as master without obeying any law, condemning to\\ndeath, and confiscating property at will. Mercenaries defended him against\\nhis enemies. The following anecdote represents the policy of the tyrants:\\n\"Periander, tyrant of Corinth, sent one day to Thrasybulus, tyrant of\\nMiletus, to ask what conduct he ought to follow in order to govern with\\nsafety.', 'Thrasybulus led the envoy into the field end walked with him\\nthrough the wheat, striking off with his staff all heads that were higher\\nthan the others. He sent off the envoy without further advice. \" The\\nmessenger took him for a fool, but Periander understood: Thrasybulus was\\ncounselling him to slay the principal citizens.', 'Everywhere the rich were killed by the tyrant and their goods confiscated;\\noften the wealth was distributed among the poor. This is why the populace\\nalways sustained the tyrant. There were tyrants in Greece from the sixth century; some, like Pisistratus,\\nPolycrates, and Pittacus, were respected for their wisdom.', 'At that time\\nevery man was called tyrant who exercised absolute power outside the\\nlimits of the constitution; it was not a title of reproach. But when the tyrants made incessant warfare on the rich they became\\nsanguinary and so were detested. Their situation is depicted in the famous\\nstory of Damocles.', 'This Damocles said to Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse,\\n\"You are the happiest of men. \" \"I will show you the delight of being a\\ntyrant,\" replied Dionysius. He had Damocles served with a sumptuous\\nfeast and ordered his servants to show the guest the same honors as to\\nhimself.', \"During the feast Damocles raised his eyes and perceived a sword\\nsuspended to the ceiling held only by a horse hair, and hanging directly\\nover his head. The comparison was a striking oneâ€”the tyrant's life hung\\nonly by a thread. The rich, his enemies, watched for an opportunity to cut\\nit, for it was regarded as praiseworthy to assassinate a tyrant.\", 'This danger\\nirritated him and made him suspicious and cruel. He dared not trust\\nanybody, believed himself secure only after the massacre of all his enemies,\\nand condemned the citizens to death on the slightest suspicion. Thus the\\nname tyrant became a synonym of injustice.', 'Exhaustion of Greece. â€”The civil wars between rich and poor continued for\\nnearly three centuries (430-150 B. C.', '). Many citizens were massacred, a\\ngreater number exiled. These exiles wandered about in poverty.', 'Knowing\\nno trade but that of a soldier, they entered as mercenaries into the armies of\\nSparta, Athens, the Great King, the Persian satrapsâ€”in short, of anybody\\nwho would hire them. There were 50,000 Greeks in the service of Darius\\nagainst Alexander. It was seldom that such men returned to their own\\ncountry.', 'Thus the cities lost their people. At the same time families became smaller,\\nmany men preferring not to marry or raise children, others having but one\\nor two. \"Is not this,\" says Polybius, \"the root of the evil, that of these two\\nchildren war or sickness removes one, then the home becomes deserted\\nand the city enfeebled?\" A time came when there were no longer enough\\ncitizens in the towns to resist a conqueror.', 'THE ROMAN CONQUEST\\nThe Greek Leagues. â€”The most discerning of the Greeks commenced to see\\nthe danger during the second war of Rome with Carthage.

A cloud is forming on that coast, it increases, and\\nimpends over Greece.', '\"\\nThe Greek cities at this time grouped themselves in two leagues hostile to\\neach other. Two little peoples, the Ã†tolians and AchÃ¦ans, had the direction\\nof them; they commanded the armies and determined on peace and war,\\njust as Athens and Sparta once did. Each league supported in the Greek\\nstates one of the two political partiesâ€”the Ã†tolian League the democratic,\\nthe AchÃ¦an League the oligarchical.', 'The Roman Allies. â€”Neither of the two leagues was strong enough to unite\\nall the Greek states. The Romans then appeared.', 'Philip, the king of\\nMacedon (197), and later Antiochus, the king of Syria (193-169), made war\\non them. Both were beaten. Rome destroyed their armies and made them\\nsurrender their fleets.', 'Perseus, the new king of Macedon, was conquered, made prisoner, and his\\nkingdom overthrown (167). The Greeks made no effort to unite for the\\ncommon defence; rich and poor persisted in their strife, and each hated the\\nother more than the foreigner. The democratic party allied itself with\\nMacedon, the oligarchical party called in the Romans.', 'While the Theban\\ndemocrats were fighting in the army of Philip, the Theban oligarchs\\nopened the town to the Roman general. At Rhodes all were condemned to\\ndeath who had acted or spoken against Rome. Even among the AchÃ¦ans,\\nCallicrates, a partisan of the Romans, prepared a list of a thousand citizens\\nwhom he accused of having been favorable to Perseus; these suspects were\\nsent to Rome where they were held twenty years without trial.', 'The Last Fight. â€”The Romans were not at first introduced as enemies. In\\n197 the consul Flamininus, after conquering the king of Macedon, betook\\nhimself to the Isthmus of Corinth and before the Greeks assembled to\\ncelebrate the games, proclaimed that \"all the Greek peoples were free.', '\" The\\ncrowd in transports of joy approached Flamininus to thank him; they\\nwished to salute their liberator, see his form, touch his hand; crowns and\\ngarlands were cast upon him. The pressure upon him was so great that he\\nwas nearly suffocated. The Romans seeing themselves in control soon wished to command.', 'The\\nrich freely recognized their sovereignty; Rome served them by shattering\\nthe party of the poor. This endured for forty years. At last in 147, Rome\\nbeing engaged with Carthage, the democratic party gained the mastery in\\nGreece and declared war on the Romans.', 'A part of the Greeks were panicstricken; many came before the Roman soldiers denouncing their\\ncompatriots and themselves; others betook themselves to a safe distance\\nfrom the cities; some hurled themselves into wells or over precipices. The\\nleaders of the opposition confiscated the property of the rich, abolished\\ndebts, and gave arms to the slaves. It was a desperate contest.', 'Once\\novercome, the AchÃ¦ans reassembled an army and marched to the combat\\nwith their wives and children. The general DiÅ“us shut himself in his house\\nwith his whole family and set fire to the building. Corinth had been the\\ncentre of the resistance; the Romans entered it, massacred the men, and\\nsold the women and children as slaves.', 'The city full of masterpieces of art\\nwas pillaged and burnt; pictures of the great painters were thrown into the\\ndust, Roman soldiers lying on them and playing at dice. THE HELLENES IN THE OCCIDENT\\nInfluence of Greece on Rome. â€”The Romans at the time of their conquest of\\nthe Greeks were still only soldiers, peasants, and merchants; they had no\\nstatues, monuments, literature, science, or philosophy.', 'All this was found\\namong the Greeks. Rome sought to imitate these, as the Assyrian\\nconquerors imitated the Chaldeans, as the Persians did the Assyrians. The\\nRomans kept their costume, tongue, and religion, and never confused these\\nwith those of the Greeks.', 'But thousands of Greek scholars and artists came\\nto establish themselves in Rome and to open schools of literature and of\\neloquence. Later it was the fashion for the youth of the great Roman\\nfamilies to go as students to the schools of Athens and Alexandria. Thus\\nthe arts and science of the Greeks were gradually introduced into Rome.', '\"Vanquished Greece overcame her savage conqueror,\" says Horace, the\\nRoman poet; \"she brought the arts to uncultured Latium. \"\\nArchitecture. â€”The Romans had a national architecture.', \"But they borrowed\\nthe column from the Greeks and often imitated their buildings. Many\\nRoman temples resemble a Greek temple. A wealthy Roman's house is composed ordinarily of two parts: the first, the\\nancient Roman house; the other is only a Greek house added to the first.\", 'Sculpture. â€”The Greeks had thousands of statues, in temples, squares of\\nthe city, gymnasia, and in their dwellings. The Romans regarded\\nthemselves as the owners of everything that had belonged to the\\nvanquished people.', 'Their generals, therefore, removed a great number of\\nstatues, transporting them to the temples and the porticos of Rome. In the\\ntriumph of Ã†milius Paullus, victor over the king of Macedon (Perseus), a\\nnotable spectacle was two hundred and fifty cars full of statues and\\npaintings. Soon the Romans became accustomed to adorn with statues their theatres,\\ncouncil-halls, and private villas; every great noble wished to have some of\\nthem and gave commissions for them to Greek artists.', 'Thus a Roman\\nschool of sculpture was developed which continued to imitate ancient\\nGreek models. And so it was Greek sculpture, a little blunted and\\ndisfigured, which was spread over all the world subject to the Romans. Literature.', 'â€”The oldest Latin writer was a Greek, Livius Andronicus, a\\nfreedman, a schoolmaster, and later an actor. The first works in Latin were\\ntranslations from the Greek. Livius Andronicus had translated the Odyssey\\nand several tragedies.', 'The Roman people took pleasure in Greek pieces\\nand would have no others. Even the Roman authors who wrote for the\\ntheatre did nothing but translate or arrange Greek tragedies and comedies. Thus the celebrated works of Plautus and of Terence are imitations of the\\ncomedies of Menander and of Diphilus, now lost to us.', 'The Romans imitated also the Greek historians. For a long time it was the\\nfashion to write history, even Roman history, in Greek. The only great Roman poets declare themselves pupils of the Greeks.', 'Lucretius writes only to expound the philosophy of Epicurus; Catullus\\nimitates the poets of Alexander; Vergil, Theocritus and Homer; Horace\\ntranslates the odes of the Greek lyrics. Epicureans and Stoics. â€”The Romans had a practical and literal spirit, very\\nindifferent to pure science and metaphysics.', 'They took interest in Greek\\nphilosophy only so far as they believed it had a bearing on morals. Epicureans and Stoics were two sects of Greek philosophers. The\\nEpicureans maintained that pleasure is the supreme good, not sensual\\npleasure, but the calm and reasonable pleasure of the temperate man;\\nhappiness consists in the quiet enjoyment of a peaceful life, surrounded\\nwith friends and without concern for imaginary goods.', \"For the Stoics the\\nsupreme good is virtue, which consists in conducting one's self according\\nto reason, with a view to the good of the whole universe. Riches, honor,\\nhealth, beauty, all the goods of earth are nothing for the wise man; even if\\none torture him, he remains happy in the possession of the true good. The Romans took sides for one or the other philosophy, usually without\\nthoroughly comprehending either.\", 'Those who passed for Epicureans spent\\ntheir lives in eating and drinking and even compared themselves to swine. Those calling themselves Stoics, like Cato and Brutus, affected a rude\\nlanguage, a solemn demeanor and emphasized the evils of life. Nevertheless these doctrines, spreading gradually, aided in destroying\\ncertain prejudices of the Romans.', 'Epicureans and Stoics were in harmony\\non two points: they disdained the ancient religion and taught that all men\\nare equal, slaves or citizens, Greeks or barbarians. Their Roman disciples\\nrenounced in their school certain old superstitions, and learned to show\\nthemselves less cruel to their slaves, less insolent toward other peoples. The conquest of Greece by the Romans gave the arts, letters, and morals of\\nthe Greeks currency in the west, just as the conquest of the Persian empire\\nby the Greeks had carried their language, customs, and religion into the\\nOrient.', 'CHAPTER XVII\\nROME\\nANCIENT PEOPLES OF ITALY\\nTHE ETRUSCANS\\nEtruria. â€”The word Italy never signified for the ancients the same as for us:\\nthe Po Valley (Piedmont and Lombardy) was a part of Gaul. The frontier\\ncountry at the north was Tuscany.', 'The Etruscans who dwelt there have left\\nit their name (Tusci). Etruria was a country at once warm and humid; the atmosphere hung\\nheavily over the inhabitants. The region on the shore of the sea where the\\nEtruscans had most of their cities is the famous Maremma, a wonderfully\\nfertile area, covered with beautiful forests, but where the water having no\\noutlet forms marshes that poison the air.', '\"In the Maremma,\" says an Italian\\nproverb, \"one gets rich in a year, but dies in six months. \"\\nThe Etruscan People. â€”The Etruscans were for the ancients, and are still for\\nus, a mysterious people.', \"They had no resemblance to their neighbor's, and\\ndoubtless they came from a distanceâ€”from Germany, Asia, or from Egypt;\\nall these opinions have been maintained, but no one of them is\\ndemonstrated. We are ignorant even of the language that they spoke. Their alphabet\\nresembles that of the Greeks, but the Etruscan inscriptions present only\\nproper names, and these are too short to furnish a key to the language.\", 'The Etruscans established twelve cities in Tuscany, united in a\\nconfederation, each with its own fortress, its king, and its government. They had colonies on both coasts, twelve in Campania in the vicinity of\\nNaples, and twelve more in the valley of the Po. Etruscan Tombs.', 'â€”There remain to us from the Etruscans only city walls\\nand tombs. When an Etruscan tomb is opened, one perceives a porch supported by\\ncolumns and behind this chambers with couches, and bodies laid on these. Round about are ornaments of gold, ivory, and amber; purple cloths,\\nutensils, and especially large painted vases.', 'On the walls are paintings of\\ncombats, games, banquets, and fantastic scenes. Industry and Commerce. â€”The Etruscans knew how to turn their fertile\\nsoil to some account, but they were for the most part mariners and traders.', 'Like the PhÅ“nicians they made long journeys to seek the ivory of India,\\namber from the Baltic, tin, the PhÅ“nician purple, Egyptian jewels adorned\\nwith hieroglyphics, and even ostrich eggs. All these objects are found in\\ntheir tombs. Their navies sailed to the south as far as Sicily.', 'The Greeks\\nhated them and called them \"savage Tyrrhenians\" or \"Etruscan pirates. \" At\\nthis time every mariner on occasion was a pirate, and the Etruscans were\\nespecially interested to exclude the Greeks so that they might keep for\\nthemselves the trade of the west coast of Italy. The famous Etruscan vases, which have been taken from the tombs by the\\nthousand to enrich our museums, were imitations of Greek vases, but\\nmanufactured by the Etruscans.', 'They represent scenes from Greek\\nmythology, especially the combats about Troy; the human figures are in\\nred on a black ground. Religion. â€”The Etruscans were a sombre people.', 'Their gods were stern,\\noften malevolent. The two most exalted gods were \"the veiled deities,\" of\\nwhom we know nothing. Below these were the gods who hurled the\\nlightning and these form a council of twelve gods.', 'Under the earth, in the\\nabode of the dead, were gods of evil omen. These are represented on the\\nEtruscan vases. The king of the lower world, Mantus, a winged genius, sits\\nwith crown on his head and torch in his hand.', 'Other demons armed with\\nsword or club with serpents in their hands receive the souls of the dead;\\nthe principal of these under the name Charun (the Charon of the Greeks),\\nan old man of hideous form, bears a heavy mallet to strike his victims. The\\nsouls of the dead (the Manes) issue from the lower world three days in the\\nyear, wandering about the earth, terrifying the living and doing them evil. Human victims are offered to appease their lust for blood.', 'The famous\\ngladiatorial combats which the Romans adopted had their origin in bloody\\nsacrifices in honor of the dead. The Augurs. â€”The Etruscans used to say that a little evil spirit named\\nTages issued one day from a furrow and revealed to the people assembled\\nthe secrets of divination.', 'The Etruscan priests who called themselves\\nharuspices or augurs had rules for predicting the future. They observed the\\nentrails of victims, the thunderbolt, but especially the flight of birds\\n(whence their name \"augurs\"). The augur at first with face turned to the\\nnorth, holding a crooked staff in his hand, describes a line which cuts the\\nheavens in two sections; the part to the right is favorable, to the left\\nunfavorable.', 'A second line cutting the first at right angles, and others\\nparallel to these form in the heavens a square which was called the Temple. The augur regarded the birds that flew in this square: some like the eagle\\nhave a lucky significance; others like the owl presage evil. The Etruscans predicted the future destiny of their own people.', 'They are\\nthe only people of antiquity who did not expect that they were to persist\\nforever. Etruria, they said, was to endure ten centuries. These centuries\\nwere not of exactly one hundred years each, but certain signs marked the\\nend of each period.', 'In the year 44, the year of the death of CÃ¦sar, a comet\\nappeared; an Etruscan haruspex stated to the Romans in an assembly of the\\npeople that this comet announced the end of the ninth century and the\\nbeginning of the tenth, the last of the Etruscan people. Influence of the Etruscans. â€”The Romans, a semi-barbarous people, always\\nimitated their more civilized neighbors, the Etruscans.', 'They drew from\\nthem especially the forms of their religion: the costume of the priests and of\\nthe magistrates, the religious rites, and the art of divining the future from\\nbirds (the auspices). When the Romans found a city, they observe the\\nEtruscan rites: the founder traces a square enclosure with a plough with\\nshare of bronze, drawn by a white bull and a white heifer. Men follow the\\nfounder and carefully cast the clods of earth from the side of the furrow.', 'The whole ditch left by the plough is sacred and is not to be crossed. To\\nallow entrance to the enclosure, it is necessary that the founder break the\\nditch at certain points, and he does this by lifting the plough and carrying\\nit an instant; the interval made in this manner remains profane and it\\nbecomes the gate by which one enters. Rome itself was founded according\\nto these rites.', 'It was called Roma Quadrata, and it was said that the\\nfounder had killed his brother to punish him for crossing the sacred\\nfurrow. Later the limits of Roman colonies and of camps, and even the\\nbounds of domains were always traced in conformity with religious rules\\nand with geometrical lines. The Roman religion was half Etruscan.', 'The Fathers of the church were\\nright, therefore, in calling Etruria the \"Mother of Superstitions. \"\\nTHE ITALIAN PEOPLE\\nUmbrians and Oscans. â€”In the rugged mountains of the Apennines, to the\\neast and south of the Roman plain, resided numerous tribes.', 'These peoples\\ndid not bear the same name and did not constitute a single nation. They\\nwere Umbrians, Sabines, Volscians, Ã†quians, Hernicans, Marsians, and\\nSamnites. But all spoke almost the same language, worshipped the same\\ngods, and had similar customs.', 'Like the Persians, Hindoos, and Greeks,\\nthey were of Aryan race; secluded in their mountains, remote from\\nstrangers, they remained like the Aryans of the ancient period; they lived\\nin groups with their herds scattered in the plains; they had no villages nor\\ncities. Fortresses erected on the mountains defended them in time of war. They were brave martial people, of simple and substantial manners.', 'They\\nlater constituted the strength of the Roman armies. A proverb ran: \"Who\\ncould vanquish the Marsians without the Marsians?\"\\nThe Sacred Spring. â€”In the midst of a pressing danger, the Sabines,\\naccording to a legend, believing their gods to be angry, decided to appease\\ntheir displeasure by sacrificing to the god of war and of death everything\\nthat was born during a certain spring.', 'This sacrifice was called a \"Sacred\\nSpring. \" All the children born in this year belonged to the god. Arrived at\\nthe age of manhood, they left the country and journeyed abroad.', 'These\\nexiles formed several groups, each taking for guide one of the sacred\\nanimals of Italy, a woodpecker, a wolf, or a bull, and followed it as a\\nmessenger of the god. Where the animal halted the band settled itself. Many peoples of Italy, it was said, had originated in these colonies of\\nemigrants and still preserved the name of the animal which had led their\\nancestors.', 'Such were, the Hirpines (people of the wolf), the Picentines\\n(people of the woodpecker), and the Samnites whose capital was named\\nBovianum (city of the ox). The Samnites. â€”The Samnites were the most powerful of all.', 'Settled in the\\nAbruzzi, a paradise for brigands, they descended into the fertile plains of\\nNaples and of Apulia and put Etruscan and Greek towns to ransom. The Samnites fought against the Romans for two centuries; although\\nalways beaten because they had no central administration and no\\ndiscipline they yet reopened the war. Their last fight was heroic.', 'An old\\nman brought to the chiefs of the army a sacred book written on linen. They\\nformed in the interior of the camp a wall of linen, raised an altar in the\\nmidst of it, and around this stood soldiers with unsheathed swords. One by\\none the bravest of the warriors entered the precinct.', 'They swore not to flee\\nbefore the enemy and to kill the fugitives. Those who took the oath, to the\\nnumber of 16,000, donned linen garments. This was the \"linen legion\"; it\\nengaged in battle, and was slaughtered to the last man.', 'The Greeks of Italy. â€”All south Italy was covered with Greek colonies,\\nsome, like Sybaris, Croton, and Tarentum, very populous and powerful. But the Greeks did not venture on the Roman coast for fear of the\\nEtruscans.', 'Except the city of CumÃ¦ the Greek colonies down to the third\\ncentury had almost no relations with the Romans. The Latins. â€”The Latins dwelt in the country of hills and ravines to the\\nsouth of the Tiber, called today the Roman Campagna.', 'They were a small\\npeople, their territory comprising no more than one hundred square miles. They were of the same race as the other Italians, similar to them in\\nlanguage, religion, and manners, but slightly more advanced in\\ncivilization. They cultivated the soil and built strong cities.', 'They separated\\nthemselves into little independent peoples. Each people had its little\\nterritory, its city, and its government. This miniature state was called a city.', 'Thirty Latin cities had formed among themselves a religious association\\nanalogous to the Greek amphictyonies. Every year they celebrated a\\ncommon festival, when their delegates, assembled at Alba, sacrificed a bull\\nin honor of their common god, the Latin Jupiter. Rome.', 'â€”On the frontier of Latium, on the borders of Etruria, in the marshy\\nplain studded with hills that followed the Tiber, rose the city of Rome, the\\ncentre of the Roman people scattered in the plain. The land was malarial\\nand dreary; but the situation was good. The Tiber served as a barrier\\nagainst the enemy from Etruria, the hills were fortresses.', 'The sea was but\\nsix leagues away, far enough to escape fear of pirates, and near enough to\\npermit the transportation of merchandise. The port of Ostia at the mouth of\\nthe Tiber was a suburb of Rome, as PirÃ¦us was of Athens. The locality was\\ntherefore agreeable to a people of soldiers and merchants.', 'Roma Quadrata and the Capitol. â€”Of the first centuries of Rome we know\\nonly some legends, and the Romans knew no more than we. Rome, they\\nsaid, was a little square town, limited to the Palatine Hill.', 'The founder\\nwhom they called Romulus had according to the Etruscan forms traced the\\ncircuit with the plough. Every year, on the 21st of April, the Romans\\ncelebrated the anniversary of these ceremonies: a procession marched\\nabout the primitive enclosure and a priest fixed a nail in a temple in\\ncommemoration of it. It was calculated that the founding had occurred in\\nthe year 754 B.', 'C. On the other hills facing the Palatine other small cities rose. A band of\\nSabine mountaineers established themselves on the Capitoline, a group\\nofEtruscan adventurers on Mount CÅ“lius; perhaps there were still other\\npeoples.', 'All these small settlements ended with uniting with Rome on the\\nPalatine. A new wall was built to include the seven hills. The Capitol was\\nthen for Rome what the Acropolis was for Athens: here rose the temples of\\nthe three protecting deities of the cityâ€”Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and the\\ncitadel that contained the treasure and the archives of the people.', 'In laying\\nthe foundations, it was said there was found a human head recently cleft\\nfrom the body; this head was a presage that Rome should become the head\\nof the world. CHAPTER XVIII\\nROMAN RELIGION\\nThe Roman Gods. â€”The Romans, like the Greeks, believed that everything\\nthat occurs in the world was the work of a deity.', 'But in place of a God who\\ndirects the whole universe, they had a deity for every phenomenon which\\nthey saw. There was a divinity to make the seed sprout, another to protect\\nthe bounds of the fields, another to guard the fruits. Each had its name, its\\nsex, and its functions.', 'The principal gods were Jupiter, god of the heaven; Janus, the two-faced\\ngod (the deity who opens); Mars, god of war; Mercury, god of trade;\\nVulcan, god of fire; Neptune, god of the sea; Ceres, goddess of grains, the\\nEarth, the Moon, Juno, and Minerva. Below these were secondary deities. Some personified a qualityâ€”for\\nexample, Youth, Concord, Health, Peace.', 'Others presided over a certain act\\nin life: when the infant came into the world there were a god to teach him\\nto speak, a goddess to teach him to drink, another charged with knitting his\\nbones, two to accompany him to school, two to take him home again. In\\nshort, there was a veritable legion of minor special deities. Other gods protected a city, a certain section of a mountain, a forest; every\\nriver, every fountain, every tree had its little local divinity.', 'It is this that\\nmakes an old woman in a Latin romance exclaim, \"Our country is so full of\\ngods that it is much easier to find a god than a man. \"\\nForm of the Gods. â€”The Romans, unlike the Greeks, did not give their gods\\na precise form.', 'For a long time there was no idol in Rome; they worshipped\\nJupiter under the form of a rock, Mars under that of a sword. It was later\\nthat they imitated the wooden statues of the Etruscans and the marbles of\\nthe Greeks. Perhaps they did not at first conceive of the gods as having\\nhuman forms.', 'Unlike the Greeks they did not imagine marriage and kinship among their\\ngods; they had no legends to tell of these relationships; they knew of no\\nOlympus where the gods met together. The Latin language had a very\\nsignificant word for designating the gods: they were called Manifestations. They were the manifestations of a mysterious divine power.', 'This is why\\nthey were formless, without family relationship, without legends. Everything that was known of the gods was that each controlled a natural\\nforce and could benefit or injure men. Principles of the Roman Religion.', 'â€”The Roman was no lover of these pale\\nand frigid abstractions; he even seemed to fear them. When he invoked\\nthem, he covered his face, perhaps that he might not see them. But he\\nthought that they were potent and that they would render him service, if\\nhe knew how to please them.', '\"The man whom the gods favor,\" says\\nPlautus, \"they cause to gain wealth. \"\\nThe Roman conceives of religion as an exchange of good offices; the\\nworshipper brings offerings and homage; the god in return confers some\\nadvantage. If after having made a present to the god the man receives\\nnothing, he considers himself cheated.', 'During the illness of Germanicus the\\npeople offered sacrifices for his restoration. When it was announced that\\nGermanicus was dead, the people in their anger overturned the altars and\\ncast the statues of the gods into the streets, because they had not done what\\nwas expected of them. And so in our day the Italian peasant abuses the\\nsaint who does not give him what he asks.', 'Worship. â€”Worship, therefore, consists in doing those things that please\\nthe gods. They are presented with fruits, milk, wine, or animal sacrifices.', 'Sometimes the statues of the gods are brought from their temples, laid on\\ncouches, and served with a feast. As in Greece, magnificent homes\\n(temples) were built for them, and diversions were arranged for them. Formalism.', 'â€”But it is not enough that one make a costly offering to the\\ngods. The Roman gods are punctilious as to form; they require that all the\\nacts of worship, the sacrifices, games, dedications, shall proceed according\\nto the ancient rules (the rites). When one desires to offer a victim to Jupiter,\\none must select a white beast, sprinkle salted meal on its head, and strike it\\nwith an axe; one must stand erect with hands raised to heaven, the abode\\nof Jupiter, and pronounce a sacred formula.', 'If any part of the ceremonial\\nfails, the sacrifice is of no avail; the god, it is thought, will have no pleasure\\nin it. A magistrate may be celebrating games in honor of the protecting\\ndeities of Rome; \"if he alters a word in his formula, if a flute-player rests, if\\nthe actor stops short, the games do not conform to the rites; they must be\\nrecommenced. \"\\nAnd so the prudent man secures the assistance of two priests, one to\\npronounce the formula, the other to follow the ritual accurately.', 'Every year the Arval Brothers, a college of priests, assemble in a temple in\\nthe environs of Rome where they perform a sacred dance and recite a\\nprayer; this is written in an archaic language which no one any longer\\ncomprehends, so much so that at the beginning of the ceremony a written\\nformulary must be given to each of the priests. And yet, ever since the time\\nthat they ceased to comprehend it, they continued to chant it without\\nchange. This is because the Romans hold before all to the letter of the law\\nin dealing with their gods.', 'This exactness in performing the prescribed\\nritual is for them their religion. And so they regarded themselves as \"the\\nmost religious of men. \" \"On all other points we are the inferiors or only the\\nequals of other peoples, but we excel all in religion, that is, the worship we\\npay the gods.', '\"\\nPrayer. â€”When the Roman prays, it is not to lift his soul and feel himself in\\ncommunion with a god, but to ask of him a service. He is concerned, then,\\nfirst to find the god who can render it.', '\"It is as important,\" says Varro, \"to\\nknow what god can aid us in a special case as to know where the carpenter\\nand baker live. \" Thus one must address Ceres if one wants rich harvests,\\nMercury to make a fortune, Neptune to have a happy voyage. Then the\\nsuppliant dons the proper garments, for the gods love neatness; he brings\\nan offering, for the gods love not that one should come with empty hands.', 'Then, erect, the head veiled, the worshipper invokes the god. But he does\\nnot know the exact name of the god, for, say the Romans, \"no one knows\\nthe true names of the gods. \" He says, then, for example, \"Jupiter, greatest\\nand best, or whatever is the name that thou preferrest.', '\" Then he proposes\\nhis request, taking care to use always the clearest expressions so that the\\ngod may make no mistake. If a libation is offered, one says, \"Receive the\\nhomage of this wine that I am pouring\"; for the god might think that one\\nwould present other wine and keep this back. The prayers, too, are long,\\nverbose, and full of repetitions.', 'Omens. â€”The Romans, like the Greeks, believe in omens. The gods, they\\nthink, know the future, and they send signs that permit men to divine\\nthem.', 'Before undertaking any act, the Roman consults the gods. The\\ngeneral about to engage in battle examines the entrails of victims; the\\nmagistrates before holding an assembly regards the passing birds (called\\n\"taking the auspices\"). If the signs are favorable, the gods are thought to\\napprove the enterprise; if not, they are against it.', 'The gods often send a\\nsign that had not been requested. Every unexpected phenomenon is the\\npresage of an event. A comet appeared before the death of CÃ¦sar and was\\nthought to have announced it.', 'When the assembly of the people deliberates and it thunders, it is because\\nJupiter does not wish that anything shall be decided on that day and the\\nassembly must dissolve. The most insignificant fact may be interpreted as a\\nsignâ€”a flash of lightning, a word overheard, a rat crossing the road, a\\ndiviner met on the way. And so when Marcellus had determined on an\\nenterprise, he had himself carried in a closed litter that he might be sure of\\nnot seeing anything which could impose itself on him as a portent.', 'These were not the superstitions of the populace; the republic supported\\nsix augurs charged with predicting the future. It carefully preserved a\\ncollection of prophecies, the Sibylline Books. It had sacred chickens\\nguarded by priests.', 'No public actâ€”assembly, election, deliberationâ€”could\\nbe done without the taking of the auspices, that is to say, observation of the\\nflight of birds. In the year 195 it was learned that lightning had struck a\\ntemple of Jupiter and that it had hit a hair on the head of the statue of\\nHercules; a governor wrote that a chicken with three feet had been hatched;\\nthe senate assembled to discuss these portents. The Priests.', 'â€”The priest in Rome, as in Greece, is not charged with the care\\nof souls, he exists only for the service of the god. He guards his temple,\\nadministers his property, and performs the ceremonies in his honor. Thus\\nthe guild of the Salii (the leapers) watches over a shield which fell from\\nheaven, they said, and which was adored as an idol; every year they\\nperform a dance in arms, and this is their sole function.', 'The augurs predict the future. The pontiffs superintend the ceremonies of\\nworship; they regulate the calendar and fix the festivals to be celebrated on\\nthe various days of the year. Neither the priests, the augurs, nor the pontiffs form a separate class.', 'They\\nare chosen from among the great families and continue to exercise all the\\nfunctions of stateâ€”judging, presiding over assemblies, and commanding\\narmies. This is the reason that the Roman priests, potent as they were, did\\nnot constitute, as in Egypt, a sacerdotal caste. At Rome it was a state\\nreligion, but not a government by the priests.', 'The Dead. â€”The Romans, like the Hindoos and the Greeks, believed that\\nthe soul survived the body. If care were taken to bury the body according\\nto the proper rites, the soul went to the lower world and became a god;\\notherwise the soul could not enter the abode of the dead, but returned to\\nthe earth terrifying the living and tormenting them until suitable burial\\nwas performed.', 'Pliny the Younger relates the story of a ghost which\\nhaunted a house and terrified to death all the inhabitants of the dwelling; a\\nphilosopher who was brave enough to follow it discovered at the place\\nwhere the spectre stopped some bones which had not been buried in the\\nproper manner. The shade of the Emperor Caligula wandered in the\\ngardens of the palace; it was necessary to disinter the body and bury it\\nanew in regular form. Cult of the Dead.', 'â€”It was of importance, therefore, to both the living and\\nthe dead that the rites should be observed. The family of the deceased\\nerected a funeral pile, burned the body on it, and placed the ashes in an urn\\nwhich was deposited in the tomb, a little chapel dedicated to theManes, i. e.', ',\\nthe souls that had become gods. On fixed days of the year the relatives\\ncame to the tomb to bring food; doubtless they believed that the soul was\\nin need of nourishment, for wine and milk were poured on the earth, flesh\\nof victims was burned, and vessels of milk and cakes were left behind. These funeral ceremonies were perpetuated for an indefinite period; a\\nfamily could not abandon the souls of its ancestors, but continued to\\nmaintain their tomb and the funeral feasts.', 'In return, these souls which had\\nbecome gods loved and protected their posterity. Each family, therefore,\\nhad its guardian deities which they called Lares. Cult of the Hearth.', 'â€”Each family had a hearth, also, that it adored. For the\\nRomans, as for the Hindoos, fire was a god and the hearth an altar. The\\nflame was to be maintained day and night, and offerings made on the\\nhearth of oil, fat, wine, and incense; the fire then became brilliant and rose\\nhigher as if nourished by the offering.', 'Before beginning his meal the Roman thanked the god of the hearth, gave\\nhim a part of the food, and poured out for him a little wine (this was the\\nlibation). Even the sceptical Horace supped with his slaves before the\\nhearth and offered libation and prayer. Every Roman family had in its house a sanctuary where were to be found\\nthe Lares, the souls of the ancestors, and the altar of the hearth.', 'Rome also\\nhad its sacred hearth, called Vesta, an ancient word signifying the hearth\\nitself. Four virgins of the noblest families, the Vestals, were charged with\\nkeeping the hearth, for it was necessary that the flame should never be\\nextinguished, and the care of it could be confided only to pure beings. If a\\nVestal broke her vow, she was buried alive in a cave, for she had\\ncommitted sacrilege and had endangered the whole Roman people.', 'THE FAMILY\\nReligion of the Family. â€”All the members of a family render worship to the\\nsame ancestors and unite about the same hearth. They have therefore the\\nsame gods, and these are their peculiar possession.', 'The sanctuary where\\nthe Lares were kept was concealed in the house and no stranger was to\\napproach it. Thus the Roman family was a little church; it had its religion\\nand its worship to which no others than its members had access. The\\nancient family was very different from the modern, having its basis in the\\nprinciples of religion.', 'Marriage. â€”The first rule of this religion is that one should be the issue of a\\nregular marriage if one is to have the right of adoring the ancestors of the\\nfamily. Roman marriage, therefore, is at the start a religious ceremony.', 'The\\nfather of the bride gives her away outside the house when a procession\\nconducts her to the house of the groom chanting an ancient sacred refrain,\\n\"Hymen, O Hymen!\" The bride is then led before the altar of the husband\\nwhere water and fire are presented, and there in the presence of the gods of\\nthe family the bride and groom divide between them a cake of meal. Marriage at this period was called confarreatio (communion through the\\ncake). Later another form of marriage was invented.', 'A relative of the bride\\nin the presence of witnesses sells her to the husband who declares that he\\nbuys her for his wife. This is marriage by sale (coemptio). For the Romans as for the Greeks marriage is a religious duty; religion\\nordains that the family should not become extinct.', 'The Roman, therefore,\\ndeclares when he marries that he takes his wife to perpetuate the family\\nthrough their children. A noble Roman who sincerely loved his wife\\nrepudiated her because she brought him no children. The Roman Woman.', 'â€”The Roman woman is never free. As a young girl,\\nshe belongs to her father who chooses her husband for her; married, she\\ncomes under the power of her husbandâ€”the jurisconsults say she is under\\nhis \"manus,\" i. e.', ', she is in the same position as his daughter. The woman\\nalways has a master who has the right of life and death over her. And yet,\\nshe is never treated like a slave.', 'She is the equal in dignity of her husband;\\nshe is called the mother of the family (materfamilias) just as her husband is\\ncalled the father of the family (paterfamilias). She is the mistress in the\\nhouse, as he is the master. She gives orders to the slaves whom she charges\\nwith all the heavy tasksâ€”the grinding of the grain, the making of bread,\\nand the cooking.', 'She sits in the seat of honor (the atrium), spins and\\nweaves, apportions work to the slaves, watches the children, and directs\\nthe house. She is not excluded from association with the men, like the\\nGreek woman; she eats at the table with her husband, receives visitors,\\ngoes into town to dinner, appears at the public ceremonies, at the theatre,\\nand even at the courts. And still she is ordinarily uncultured; the Romans\\ndo not care to instruct their daughters; the quality which they most admire\\nin woman is gravity, and on her tomb they write by way of eulogy, \"She\\nkept the house and spun linen.', '\"\\nThe Children. â€”The Roman child belongs to the father like a piece of\\nproperty. The father has the right of exposing him in the street.', 'If he\\naccepts the child, the latter is brought up at first in the house. Girls remain\\nhere until marriage; they spin and weave under the supervision of their\\nmother. The boys walk to the fields with their father and exercise\\nthemselves in arms.', 'The Romans are not an artistic people; they require no\\nmore of their children than that they know how to read, write, and reckon;\\nneither music nor poetry is taught them. They are brought up to be sober,\\nsilent, modest in their demeanor, and obedient. The Father of the Family.', 'â€”The master of the house was called by the\\nRomans the father of the family. The paterfamilias is at once the proprietor\\nof the domain, the priest of the cult of the ancestors, and the sovereign of\\nthe family. He reigns as master in his house.', 'He has the right of\\nrepudiating his wife, of rejecting his children, of selling them, and\\nmarrying them at his pleasure. He can take for himself all that belongs to\\nthem, everything that his wife brings to him, and everything that his\\nchildren gain; for neither the wife nor the children may be proprietors. Finally he has over them all the \"right of life and death,\" that is to say, he is\\ntheir only judge.', 'If they commit crime, it is not the magistrate who\\npunishes them, but the father of the family who condemns them. One day\\n(186 B. C.', ') the Roman Senate decreed the penalty of death for all those who\\nhad participated in the orgies of the cult of Bacchus. The men were\\nexecuted, but for all the women who were discovered among the guilty, it\\nwas necessary that the Senate should address itself to the fathers of\\nfamilies, and it was these who condemned to death their wives or their\\ndaughters. \"The husband,\" said the elder Cato, \"is the judge of the wife, he\\ncan do with her as he will; if she has committed any fault, he chastises her;\\nif she has drunk wine, he condemns her; if she has been unfaithful to him,\\nhe kills her.', '\" When Catiline conspired against the Senate, a senator\\nperceived that his own son had taken part in the conspiracy; he had him\\narrested, judged him, and condemned him to death. The power of the father of the family endured as long as life; the son was\\nnever freed from it. Even if he became consul, he remained subject to the\\npower of his father.', 'When the father died, the sons became in turn fathers\\nof families. As for the wife, she could never attain freedom; she fell under\\nthe power of the heir of her husband; she could, then, become subject to her\\nown son. CHAPTER XIX\\nTHE ROMAN CITY\\nFORMATION OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE\\nThe Kings.', 'â€”Tradition relates that Rome for two centuries and a half was\\ngoverned by kings. They told not only the names of these kings and the\\ndate of their death, but the life of each. They said there were seven kings.', 'Romulus, the first king, came from the\\nLatin city of Alba, founded the hamlet on the Palatine, and killed his\\nbrother who committed the sacrilege of leaping over the sacred furrow\\nencircling the settlement; he then allied himself with Tatius, a Sabine king. (A legend of later origin added that he had founded at the foot of the hillcity a quarter surrounded with a palisade where he received all the\\nadventurers who wished to come to him. )\\nNuma Pompilius, the second king, was a Sabine.', 'It was he who organized\\nthe Roman religion, taking counsel with a goddess, the nymph Egeria who\\ndwelt in a wood. The third king, Tullus Hostilius, was a warrior. He made war on Alba, the\\ncapital of the Latin confederation, took and destroyed it.', 'Ancus Martius, the fourth king, was the grandson of Numa and built the\\nwooden bridge over the Tiber and founded the port of Ostia through which\\ncommerce passed up the river to Rome. The last three kings were Etruscans. Tarquin the Elder enlarged the\\nterritory of Rome and introduced religious ceremonies from Etruria.', 'Servius Tullius organized the Roman army, admitting all the citizens\\nwithout distinction of birth and separating them into centuries (companies)\\naccording to wealth. The last king, Tarquinius Superbus, oppressed the\\ngreat families of Rome; some of the nobles conspired against him and\\nsucceeded in expelling him. Since this time there were no longer any kings.', 'The Roman state, or as they said, the commonwealth (res publica) was\\ngoverned by the consuls, two magistrates elected each year. It is impossible to know how much truth there is in this tradition, for it\\ntook shape a long time after the Romans began to write their history, and it\\nincludes so many legends that we cannot accept it in its entirety. Attempt has been made to explain these names of kings as symbols of a\\nrace or class.', 'The early history of Rome has been reconstructed in a variety\\nof ways, but the greater the labor applied to it, the less the agreement\\namong students with regard to it. The Roman People. â€”About the fifth century before Christ there were in\\nRome two classes of people, the patricians and the plebeians.', 'The\\npatricians were the descendants of the old families who had lived from\\nremote antiquity on the little territory in the vicinity of the city; they alone\\nhad the right to appear in the assembly of the people, to assist in religious\\nceremonies, and to hold office. Their ancestors had founded the Roman\\nstate, or as they called it, the Roman city (Civitas), and these had\\nbequeathed it to them. And so they were the true people of Rome.', 'The Plebs. â€”The plebeians were descended from the foreigners established\\nin the city, and especially from the conquered peoples of the neighboring\\ncities; for Rome had gradually subjected all the Latin cities and had forcibly\\nannexed their inhabitants. Subjects and yet aliens, they obeyed the\\ngovernment of Rome, but they could have no part in it.', 'They did not\\npossess the Roman religion and could not participate in its ceremonies. They had not even the right of intermarrying with the patrician families. They were called the plebs (the multitude) and were not considered a part\\nof the Roman people.', 'In the old prayers we still find this formula: \"For the\\nwelfare of the people and the plebs of Rome. \"\\nStrife between Patricians and Plebeians. â€”The people and the plebs were\\nlike two distinct peoples, one of masters, the other of subjects.', 'And yet the\\nplebeians were much like the patricians. Soldiers, like them, they served in\\nthe army at their own cost and suffered death in the service of the Roman\\npeople; peasants like them, they lived on their domains. Many of the\\nplebeians were rich and of ancient family.', 'The only difference was that\\nthey were descended from a great family of some conquered Latin city,\\nwhile the patricians were the scions of an old family in the conquering city. Tribunes of the Plebs. â€”One day, says the legend, the plebeians, finding\\nthemselves mistreated, withdrew under arms to a mountain, determined to\\nbreak with the Roman people.', 'The patricians in consternation sent to them\\nMenenius Agrippa who told them the fable of the members and the\\nstomach. The plebs consented to return but they made a treaty with the\\npeople. It was agreed that their chiefs (they called them tribunes of the\\nplebs) should have the right of protecting the plebeians against the\\nmagistrates of the people and of prohibiting any measure against them.', 'All\\nthat was necessary was to pronounce the word \"Veto\" (I forbid); this single\\nword stopped everything; for religion prevented attacks on a tribune under\\npenalty of being devoted to the infernal gods. Triumph of the Plebs. â€”The strife between the two orders beginning at the\\nend of the fifth century continued for two centuries (494 B.', 'C. to about 300\\nB. C.', '). The plebeians, much more numerous and wealthy, ended by gaining the\\nvictory. They first secured the adoption of laws common to the two orders;\\nafterward that marriage should be permitted between the patricians and\\nthe plebeians.', 'The hardest task was to obtain the high magistracies, or, as it\\nwas said, \"secure the honors. \" Religious scruple ordained, indeed, that\\nbefore one could be named as a magistrate, the gods must be asked for\\ntheir approval of the choice. This was determined by inspecting the flight\\nof birds (\"taking the auspices\").', 'But the old Roman religion allowed the\\nauspices to be taken only on the name of a patrician; it was not believed\\nthat the gods could accept a plebeian magistrate. But there were great\\nplebeian families who were bent on being the equals of the patrician\\nfamilies in dignity, as they were in riches and in importance. They\\ngradually forced the patricians to open to them all the offices, beginning\\nwith the consulship, and ending with the great pontifical office (Pontifex\\nMaximus).', 'The first plebeian consul was named in 366 B. C. , the first\\nplebeian pontifex maximus in 302 B.', 'C. Patricians and plebeians then\\ncoalesced and henceforth formed but one people. THE ROMAN PEOPLE\\nThe Right of Citizenship.', 'â€”The people in Rome, as in Greece, is not the\\nwhole of the inhabitants, but the body of citizens. Not every man who lives\\nin the territory is a citizen, but only he who has the right of citizenship. The\\ncitizen has numerous privileges:\\n1.', 'He alone is a member of the body politic; he alone has the right of voting\\nin the assemblies of the Roman people, of serving in the army, of being\\npresent at the religious ceremonials at Rome, of being elected a Roman\\nmagistrate. These are what were called public rights. 2.', 'The citizen alone is protected by the Roman law; he only has the right of\\nmarrying legally, of becoming the father of a family, that is to say, of being\\nmaster of his wife and his children, of making his will, of buying or selling. These were the private rights. Those who were not citizens were not only excluded from the army and\\nthe assembly, but they could not marry, could not possess the absolute\\npower of the father, could not hold property legally, could not invoke the\\nRoman law, nor demand justice at a Roman tribunal.', 'Thus the citizens\\nconstituted an aristocracy amidst the other inhabitants of the city. But they\\nwere not equal among themselves; there were class differences, or, as the\\nRomans said, ranks. The Nobles.', 'â€”In the first rank are the nobles. A citizen is noble when one of\\nhis ancestors has held a magistracy, for the magisterial office in Rome is an\\nhonor, it ennobles the occupant and also his posterity. When a citizen becomes Ã¦dile, prÃ¦tor, or consul, he receives a purplebordered toga, a sort of throne (the curule chair), and the right of having an\\nimage made of himself.', 'These images are statuettes, at first in wax, later in\\nsilver. They are placed in the atrium, the sanctuary of the house, near the\\nhearth and the gods of the family; there they stand in niches like idols,\\nvenerated by posterity. When any one of the family dies, the images are\\nbrought forth and carried in the funeral procession, and a relative\\npronounces the oration for the dead.', 'It is these images that ennoble a\\nfamily that preserves them. The more images there are in a family, the\\nnobler it is. The Romans spoke of those who were \"noble by one image\"\\nand those who were \"noble by many images.', '\"\\nThe noble families of Rome were very few (they would not amount to 300),\\nfor the magistracies which conferred nobility were usually given to men\\nwho were already noble. The Knights. â€”Below the nobles were the knights.', 'They were the rich who\\nwere not noble. Their fortune as inscribed on the registers of the treasury\\nmust amount to at least 400,000 sesterces. They were merchants, bankers,\\nand contractors; they did not govern, but they grew rich.', 'At the theatre\\nthey had places reserved for them behind the nobles. If a knight were elected to a magistracy, the nobles called him a \"new man\"\\nand his son became noble. The Plebs.', 'â€”Those who were neither nobles nor knights formed the mass of\\nthe people, the plebs. The majority of them were peasants, cultivating a\\nlittle plat in Latium or in the Sabine country. They were the descendants of\\nthe Latins or the Italians who were subjugated by the Romans.', 'Cato the\\nElder in his book on Agriculture gives us an idea of their manners: \"Our\\nancestors, when they wished to eulogize a man, said \\'a good workman,\\' \\'a\\ngood farmer\\'; this encomium seemed the greatest of all. \"\\nHardened to work, eager for the harvest, steady and economical, these\\nlaborers constituted the strength of the Roman armies. For a long time they\\nformed the assembly too, and dictated the elections.', 'The nobles who\\nwished to be elected magistrates came to the parade-ground to grasp the\\nhand of these peasants (\"prensare manus,\" was the common expression). A\\ncandidate, finding the hand of a laborer callous, ventured to ask him, \"Is it\\nbecause you walk on your hands?\" He was a noble of great family, but he\\nwas not elected. The Freedmen.', 'â€”The last of all the citizens are the freedmen, once slaves,\\nor the sons of slaves. The taint of their origin remains on them; they are not\\nadmitted to service in the Roman army and they vote after all the rest. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC\\nThe Comitia.', 'â€”The government of Rome called itself a republic\\n(Respublica), that is to say, a thing of the people. The body of citizens\\ncalled the people was regarded as absolute master in the state. It is this\\nbody that elects the magistrates, votes on peace and war, and that makes\\nthe laws.', '\"The law,\" say the jurisconsults, \"is what the Roman people\\nordains. \" At Rome, as in Greece, the people do not appoint deputies, they\\npass on the business itself. Even after more than 500,000 men scattered over\\nall Italy were admitted into the citizenship, the citizens had to go in person\\nto Rome to exercise their rights.', 'The people, therefore, meet at but one\\nplace; the assembly is called the Comitia. A magistrate convokes the people and presides over the body. Sometimes\\nthe people are convoked by the blast of the trumpet and come to the\\nparade-ground (the Campus Martius), ranging themselves by companies\\nunder their standards.', 'This is the Comitia by centuries. Sometimes they\\nassemble in the market-place (the forum) and separate themselves into\\nthirty-five groups, called tribes. Each tribe in turn enters an enclosed space\\nwhere it does its voting.', 'This is the Comitia by tribes. The magistrate who\\nconvokes the assembly indicates the business on which the suffrages are to\\nbe taken, and when the assembly has voted, it dissolves. The people are\\nsovereign, but accustomed to obey their chiefs.', 'The Magistrates. â€”Every year the people elect officials to govern them and\\nto them they delegate absolute power. These are called magistrates (those\\nwho are masters).', 'Lictors march before them bearing a bundle of rods and\\nan axe, emblems of the magisterial powers of chastising and condemning\\nto death. The magistrate has at once the functions of presiding over the\\npopular assembly and the senate, of sitting in court, and of commanding\\nthe army; he is master everywhere. He convokes and dissolves the\\nassembly at will, he alone renders judgment, he does with the soldiers as\\nhe pleases, putting them to death without even taking counsel with his\\nofficers.', 'In a war against the Latins Manlius, the Roman general, had\\nforbidden the soldiers leaving camp: his son, provoked by one of the\\nenemy, went forth and killed him; Manlius had him arrested and executed\\nhim immediately. According to the Roman expression, the magistrate has the power of a\\nking; but this power is brief and divided. The magistrate is elected for but\\none year and he has a colleague who has the same power as himself.', 'There\\nare at once in Rome two consuls who govern the people and command the\\narmies, and several prÃ¦tors to serve as subordinate governors or\\ncommanders and to pronounce judgment. There are other magistrates,\\nbesidesâ€”two censors, four Ã¦diles to supervise the public ways and the\\nmarkets, ten tribunes of the plebs, and quÃ¦stors to care for the state\\ntreasure. The Censors.', 'â€”The highest of all the magistrates are the censors. They are\\ncharged with taking the census every five years, that is to say, the\\nenumeration of the Roman people. All the citizens appear before them to\\ndeclare under oath their name, the number of their children and their\\nslaves, the amount of their fortune; all this is inscribed on the registers.', 'It is\\ntheir duty, too, to draw up the list of the senators, of the knights, and of the\\ncitizens, assigning to each his proper rank in the city. They are charged as a\\nresult with making the lustrum, a great ceremony of purification which\\noccurs every five years. On that day all the citizens are assembled on the Campus Martius arranged\\nin order of battle; thrice there are led around the assembly three expiatory\\nvictims, a bull, a ram, and a swine; these are killed and their blood\\nsprinkled on the people; the city is purified and reconciled with the gods.', 'The censors are the masters of the registration and they rank each as they\\nplease; they may degrade a senator by striking him from the senate-list, a\\nknight by not registering him among the knights, and a citizen by not\\nplacing his name on the registers of the tribes. It is for them an easy means\\nof punishing those whom they regard at fault and of reaching those whom\\nthe law does not condemn. They have been known to degrade citizens for\\npoor tillage of the soil and for having too costly an equipage, a senator\\nbecause he possessed ten pounds of silver, another for having repudiated\\nhis wife.', 'It is this overweening power that the Romans call the supervision\\nof morals. It makes the censors the masters of the city. The Senate.', 'â€”The Senate is composed of about 300 persons appointed by\\nthe censor. But the censor does not appoint at random; he chooses only rich\\ncitizens respected and of high family, the majority of them former\\nmagistrates. Almost always he appoints those who are already members of\\nthe Senate, so that ordinarily one remains a senator for life.', 'The Senate is an\\nassembly of the principal men of Rome, hence its authority. As soon as\\nbusiness is presented, one of the magistrates convokes the senators in a\\ntemple, lays the question before them, and then asks \"what they think\\nconcerning this matter. \" The senators reply one by one, following the order\\nof dignity.', 'This is what they call \"consulting the Senate,\" and the judgment\\nof the majority is a senatus consultum (decree of the Senate). This\\nconclusion is only advisory as the Senate has no power to make laws; but\\nRome obeys this advice as if it were a law. The people have confidence in\\nthe senators, knowing that they have more experience than themselves; the\\nmagistrates do not dare to resist an assembly composed of nobles who are\\ntheir peers.', 'And so the Senate regulates all public business: it declares war\\nand determines the number of the armies; it receives ambassadors and\\nmakes peace; it fixes the revenues and the expenses. The people ratify these\\nmeasures and the magistrates execute them. In 200 B.', 'C. the Senate decided\\non war with the king of Macedon, but the people in terror refused to\\napprove it: the Senate then ordered a magistrate to convoke the comitia\\nanew and to adopt a more persuasive speech. This time the people voted\\nfor the war.', 'In Rome it was the people who reigned, just as is the case with\\nthe king in England, but it was the Senate that governed. The Offices. â€”Being magistrate or senator in Rome is not a profession.', 'Magistrates or senators spend their time and their money without\\nreceiving any salary. A magistracy in Rome is before all an honor. Entrance\\nto it is to nobles, at most to knights, but always to the rich; but these come\\nto the highest magistracies only after they have occupied all the others.', 'The\\nman who aims one day to govern Rome must serve in the army during ten\\ncampaigns. Then he may be elected quÃ¦stor and he receives the\\nadministration of the state treasury. After this he becomes Ã¦dile, charged\\nwith the policing of the city and with the provision of the corn supply.', 'Later he is elected prÃ¦tor and gives judgment in the courts. Later yet,\\nelected consul, he commands an army and presides over the assemblies. Then only may he aspire to the censorship.', 'This is the highest round of the\\nladder and may be reached hardly before one\\'s fiftieth year. The same man\\nhas therefore, been financier, administrator, judge, general, and governor\\nbefore arriving at this original function of censor, the political distribution\\nof the Roman people. This series of offices is what is called the \"order of the\\nhonors.', '\" Each of these functions lasts but one year, and to rise to the one\\nnext higher a new election is necessary. In the year which precedes the\\nvoting one must show one\\'s self continually in the streets, \"circulate\" as the\\nRomans say (ambire: hence the word \"ambition\"), to solicit the suffrages of\\nthe people. For all this time it is the custom to wear a white toga, the very\\nsense of the word \"candidate\" (white garment).', \"CHAPTER XX\\nROMAN CONQUEST\\nTHE ROMAN ARMY\\nMilitary Service. â€”To be admitted to service in the Roman army one must\\nbe a Roman citizen. It is necessary to have enough wealth to equip one's\\nself at one's own expense, for the state furnishes no arms to its soldiers;\\ndown to 402 B.\", 'C. it did not even pay them. And so only those citizens are\\nenrolled who are provided with at least a small fortune.', 'The poor (called\\nthe proletariat) are exempt from service, or rather, they have no right to\\nserve. Every citizen who is rich enough to be admitted to the army owes\\nthe state twenty campaigns; until these are completed the man remains at\\nthe disposition of the consul and this from the age of seventeen to forty-six. In Rome, as in the Greek cities, every man is at once citizen and soldier.', 'The Romans are a people of small proprietors disciplined in war. The Levy. â€”When there was need of soldiers, the consul ordered all the\\ncitizens qualified for service to assemble at the Capitol.', 'There the officers\\nelected by the people chose as many men as were necessary to form the\\narmy. This was the enrolment (the Romans called it the Choice); then came\\nthe military oath. The officers first took the oath, and then the rank and file;\\nthey swore to obey their general, to follow him wherever he led them and\\nto remain under the standards until he released them from their oath.', 'One\\nman pronounced the formula and each in turn advanced and said, \"I also. \"\\nFrom this time the army was bound to the general by the bonds of religion. Legions and Allies.', 'â€”The Roman army was at first called the Legion (levy). When the people increased in number, instead of one legion, several were\\nformed. The legion was a body of 4,200 to 5,000 men, all Roman citizens.', 'The\\nsmallest army had always at least one legion, every army commanded by a\\nconsul had at least two. But the legions constituted hardly a half of the\\nRoman army. All the subject peoples in Italy were required to send troops,\\nand these soldiers, who were called allies, were placed under the orders of\\nRoman officers.', 'In a Roman army the allies were always a little more\\nnumerous than the citizens of the legions. Ordinarily with four legions\\n(16,800 men) there were enrolled 20,000 archers and 40,000 horse from the\\nallies. In the Second Punic War, in 218 B.', 'C. , 26,000 citizens and 45,000 allies\\nwere drawn for service. Thus the Roman people, in making war, made use\\nof its subjects as well as of its citizens.', 'Military Exercises. â€”Rome had no gymnasium; the future soldiers\\nexercised themselves on the parade-ground, the Campus Martius, on the\\nother side of the Tiber. There the young man marched, ran, leaped under\\nthe weight of his arms, fenced with his sword, hurled the javelin, wielded\\nthe mattock, and then, covered with dust and with perspiration, swam\\nacross the Tiber.', 'Often the older men, sometimes even the generals,\\nmingled with the young men, for the Roman never ceased to exercise. Even\\nin the campaign the rule was not to allow the men to be unoccupied; once a\\nday, at least, they were required to take exercise, and when there was\\nneither enemy to fight nor intrenchment to erect, they were employed in\\nbuilding roads, bridges, and aqueducts. The Camp.', 'â€”The Roman soldier carried a heavy burdenâ€”his arms, his\\nutensils, rations for seventeen days, and a stake, in all sixty Roman pounds. The army moved more rapidly as it was not encumbered with baggage. Every time that a Roman army halted for camp, a surveyor traced a square\\nenclosure, and along its lines the soldiers dug a deep ditch; the earth which\\nwas excavated, thrown inside, formed a bank which they fortified with\\nstakes.', 'The camp was thus defended by a ditch and a palisade. In this\\nimprovised fortress the soldiers erected their tents, and in the middle was\\nset the PrÃ¦torium, the tent of the general. Sentinels mounted guard\\nthroughout the night, and so prevented the army from being surprised.', 'The Order of Battle. â€”In the presence of the enemy the soldiers did not\\nform in a solid mass, as did the Greeks. The legion was divided into small\\nbodies of 120 men, called maniples because they had for standards bundles\\nof hay.', 'The maniples were ranged in quincunx form in three lines, each\\nseparated from the neighboring maniple in such a way as to manÅ“uvre\\nseparately. The soldiers of the maniples of the first line hurled their\\njavelins, grasped their swords, and began the battle. If they were repulsed,\\nthey withdrew to the rear through the vacant spaces.', 'The second line of the\\nmaniples then in turn marched to the combat. If it was repulsed, it fell back\\non the third line. The third line was composed of the best men of the legion\\nand was equipped with lances.', 'They received the others into their ranks\\nand threw themselves on the enemy. The army was no longer a single mass\\nincapable of manÅ“uvring; the general could form his lines according to the\\nnature of the ground. At CynoscephalÃ¦, where for the first time the two\\nmost renowned armies of antiquity met, the Roman legion and the\\nMacedonian phalanx, the ground was bristling with hills; on this rugged\\nground the 16,000 Macedonion hoplites could not remain in order, their\\nranks were opened, and the Roman platoons threw themselves into the\\ngaps and demolished the phalanx.', 'Discipline. â€”The Roman army obeyed a rude discipline. The general had\\nthe right of life and death over all his men.', 'The soldier who quitted his post\\nor deserted in battle was condemned to death; the lictors bound him to a\\npost, beat him with rods, and cut off his head; or the soldiers may have\\nkilled him with blows of their staves. When an entire body of troops\\nmutinied, the general separated the guilty into groups of ten and drew by\\nlot one from every group to be executed. This was called decimation (from\\ndecimus, the tenth).', 'The others were placed on a diet of barley-bread and\\nmade to camp outside the lines, always in danger of surprise from the\\nenemy. The Romans never admitted that their soldiers were conquered or\\ntaken prisoners: after the battle of CannÃ¦ the 3,000 soldiers who escaped\\nthe carnage were sent by the senate to serve in Sicily without pay and\\nwithout honors until the enemy should be expelled from Italy; the 8,000 left\\nin the camp were taken by Hannibal who offered to return them for a small\\nransom, but the senate refused to purchase them. Colonies and Military Roads.', 'â€”In the countries that were still only partially\\nsubject, Rome established a small garrison. This body of soldiers founded a\\ntown which served as a fortress, and around about it the lands were cut\\ninto small domains and distributed to the soldiers. This is what they called\\na Colony.', 'The colonists continued to be Roman citizens and obeyed all\\ncommands from Rome. Quite different from a Greek colony which\\nemancipated itself even to the point of making war on its mother city, the\\nRoman colony remained a docile daughter. It was only a Roman garrison\\nposted in the midst of the enemy.', 'Almost all these military posts were in\\nItaly, but there were others besides; Narbonne and Lyons were once\\nRoman colonies. To hold these places and to send their armies to a distance the Romans\\nbuilt military roads. These were causeways constructed in a straight line, of\\nlimestone, stone, and sand.', 'The Romans covered their empire with them. In a land like France there is no part where one does not find traces of the\\nRoman roads. CHARACTER OF THE CONQUEST\\nWar.', 'â€”There was at Rome a temple consecrated to the god Janus whose\\ngates remained open while the Roman people continued at war. For the\\nfive hundred years of the republic this temple was closed but once and that\\nfor only a few years. Rome, then, lived in a state of war.', 'As it had the\\nstrongest army of the time, it finished by conquering all the other peoples\\nand by overcoming the ancient world. Conquest of Italy. â€”Rome began by subjecting her neighbors, the Latins,\\nfirst, then the little peoples of the south, the Volscians, the Ã†quians, the\\nHernicans, later the Etruscans and the Samnites, and finally the Greek\\ncities.', 'This was the hardest and slowest of their conquests: beginning with\\nthe time of the kings, it did not terminate until 266, after four centuries of\\nstrife. The Romans had to fight against peoples of the same race as themselves, as\\nvigorous and as brave as they. Some who were not content to obey they\\nexterminated.', 'The rich plains of the Volscians became a swampy\\nwilderness, uninhabitable even to the present time, the gloomy region of\\nthe Pontine marshes. In the land of the Samnites there were still recognizable, three hundred\\nyears after the war, the forty-five camps of Decius and the eighty-six of\\nFabius, less apparent by the traces of their intrenchments than by the\\nsolitude of the neighborhood. The Punic Wars.', 'â€”Come into Sicily, Rome antagonized Carthage. Then\\nbegan the Punic wars (that is to say, against the PhÅ“nicians). There were\\nthree of these wars.', 'The first, from 264 to 241, was determined by naval\\nbattles; Rome became mistress of Sicily. It was related that Rome had never\\nhad any war-ships, that she took as a model a Carthaginian galley cast\\nashore by accident on her coast and began by exercising her oarsmen in\\nrowing on the land. This legend is without foundation for the Roman navy\\nhad long endured.', 'This is the Roman account of this war: the Roman\\nconsul Duillius had vanquished the Carthaginian fleet at MylÃ¦ (260); a\\nRoman army had disembarked in Africa under the lead of Regulus, had\\nbeen attacked and destroyed (255); Regulus was sent as a prisoner to Rome\\nto conclude a peace, but persuading the Senate to reject it, he returned to\\nCarthage where he perished by torture. The war was concentrated in Sicily\\nwhere the Carthaginian fleet, at first victorious at Drepana, was defeated at\\nthe Ã†gates Islands; Hamilcar, besieged on Mount Eryx, signed the peace. The second war (from 218 to 201) was the work of Hannibal.', 'The third war was a war of extermination: the Romans took Carthage by\\nassault, razed it, and conquered Africa. These wars had long made Rome tremble. Carthage had the better navy,\\nbut its warriors were armed adventurers fighting not for country but for\\npay, lawless, terrible under a general like Hannibal.', 'Hannibal. â€”Hannibal, who directed the whole of the second war and\\nalmost captured Rome, was of the powerful family of the Barcas. His father\\nHamilcar had commanded a Carthaginian army in the first Punic war and\\nhad afterwards been charged with the conquest of Spain.', 'Hannibal was\\nthen but a child, but his father took him with him. The departure of an\\narmy was always accompanied by sacrifices to the gods of the country; it\\nwas said that Hamilcar after the sacrifice made his infant son swear eternal\\nenmity to Rome. Hannibal, brought up in the company of the soldiers, became the best\\nhorseman and the best archer of the army.', 'War was his only aim in life; his\\nonly needs, therefore, were a horse and arms. He had made himself so\\npopular that at the death of Hasdrubal who was in the command of the\\narmy, the soldiers elected him general without waiting for orders from the\\nCarthaginian senate. Thus Hannibal found himself at the age of twenty-one\\nat the head of an army which was obedient only to himself.', 'He began war,\\nregardless of the senate at Carthage, by advancing to the siege of\\nSaguntum, a Greek colony allied with Rome; he took this and destroyed it. The glory of Hannibal was that he did not wait for the Romans, but had the\\naudacity to march into Italy to attack them. As he had no fleet, he resolved\\nto advance by land, through the Pyrenees, crossing the Rhone and the\\nAlps.', 'He made sure of the alliance of the Gallic peoples and penetrated the\\nPyrenees with an army of 60,000 men, African and Spanish mercenaries,\\nand with 37 war-elephants. A Gallic people wished to stop him at the\\nRhone, but he sent a detachment to pass the river some leagues farther up\\nthe stream and to attack the Gauls in the rear; the mass of the army crossed\\nthe river in boats, the elephants on great rafts. He next ascended the valley of the IsÃ¨re and arrived at the Alps at the end\\nof October; he crossed them regardless of the snow and the attacks of the\\nmountaineers; many men and horses rolled down the precipices.', 'But nine\\ndays were consumed in attaining the summits of the Alps. The descent was\\nvery difficult; the pass by which he had to go was covered with ice and he\\nwas compelled to cut a road out of the rock. When he arrived in the plain,\\nthe army was reduced to half its former number.', 'Hannibal met three Roman armies in succession, first at the Ticinus, next\\non the banks of the Trebia, and last near Lake Trasimenus in Etruria. He\\nrouted all of them. As he advanced, his army increased in number; the\\nwarriors of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) joined him against the Romans.', 'He took up position beyond Rome in Apulia, and it was here that the\\nRoman army came to attack him. Hannibal had an army only half as large\\nas theirs, but he had African cavalrymen mounted on swift horses; he\\nformed his lines in the plain of CannÃ¦ so that the Romans had the sun in\\ntheir face and the dust driven by the wind against them; the Roman army\\nwas surrounded and almost annihilated (216). It was thought that Hannibal\\nwould march on Rome, but he did not consider himself strong enough to\\ndo it.', 'The Carthaginian senate sent him no reÃ«nforcements. Hannibal\\nendeavored to take Naples and to have Rome attacked by the king of\\nMacedon; he succeeded only in gaining some towns which Rome besieged\\nand destroyed. Hannibal remained nine years in south Italy; at last his\\nbrother Hasdrubal started with the army of Spain to assist him, and made\\nhis way almost to central Italy.', 'The two Carthaginian armies marched to\\nunite their forces, each opposed by a Roman army under the command of a\\nconsul. Nero, facing Hannibal, had the audacity to traverse central Italy\\nand to unite with his colleague who was intrenched against Hasdrubal. One morning Hasdrubal heard the trumpets sounding twice in the camp of\\nthe Romans, a sign that there were two consuls in the camp.', 'He believed\\nhis brother was conquered and so retreated; the Romans pursued him, he\\nwas killed and his entire army massacred. Then Nero rejoined the army\\nwhich he had left before Hannibal and threw the head of Hasdrubal into\\nthe Carthaginian camp (207). Hannibal, reduced to his own troops,\\nremained in Calabria for five years longer.', \"The descent of a Roman army\\non Africa compelled him to leave Italy; he massacred the Italian soldiers\\nwho refused to accompany him and embarked for Carthage (203). The\\nbattle of Zama (202) terminated the war. Hannibal had counted as usual on\\ndrawing the Romans within his lines and surrounding them; but Scipio, the\\nRoman general, kept his troops in order and on a second attack threw the\\nenemy's army into rout.\", 'Carthage was obliged to treat for peace; she\\nrelinquished everything she possessed outside of Africa, ceding Spain to\\nthe Romans. She bound herself further to surrender her navy and the\\nelephants, to pay over $10,000,000 and to agree not to make war without\\nthe permission of Rome. Hannibal reorganized Carthage for a new war.', 'The Romans, disturbed at\\nthis, demanded that the Carthaginians put him to death. Hannibal fled to\\nAntiochus, king of Syria, and proposed to him to incite a revolt in Italy\\nagainst Rome; but Antiochus, following the counsel of his courtiers,\\ndistrusted Hannibal and invaded Greece, where his army was captured. Hannibal withdrew to the king of Bithynia.', 'The Romans sent Flamininus\\nthither to take him, but Hannibal, seeing his house surrounded, took the\\npoison which he always had by him (183). Conquests of the Orient. â€”The Greek kings, successors of the generals of\\nAlexander, divided the Orient among themselves.', 'The most powerful of\\nthese took up war against Rome; but they were defeatedâ€”Philip, the king\\nof Macedon, in 197, his son Perseus in 168, Antiochus, the king of Syria, in\\n190. The Romans, having from this time a free field, conquered one by one\\nall the lands which they found of use to them: Macedon (148), the kingdom\\nof Pergamum (129), the rest of Asia (from 74 to 64) after the defeat of\\nMithradates, and Egypt (30). With the exception of the Macedonians, the Orient opposed the Romans\\nwith mercenaries only or with undisciplined barbarians who fled at the\\nfirst onset.', 'In the great victory over Antiochus at Magnesia there were only\\n350 Romans killed. At ChÃ¦ronea, Sulla was victorious with the loss of but\\ntwelve men. The other kings, now terrified, obeyed the Senate without\\nresistance.', 'Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, having conquered a part of Egypt, was\\nbidden by Popilius acting under the command of the Senate to abandon his\\nconquest. Antiochus hesitated; but Popilius, taking a rod in his hand, drew\\na circle about the king, and said, \"Before you move from this circle, give\\nanswer to the Senate. \" Antiochus submitted, and surrendered Egypt.', 'The\\nking of Numidia desired of the Senate that it should regard his kingdom as\\nthe property of the Roman people. Prusias, the king of Bithynia, with\\nshaved head and in the garb of a freedman, prostrated himself before the\\nSenate. Mithradates alone, king of Pontus, endeavored to resist; but after\\nthirty years of war he was driven from his states and compelled to take his\\nlife by poison.', 'Conquest of the Barbarian Lands. â€”The Romans found more difficult the\\nsubjection of the barbarous and warlike peoples of the west. A century was\\nrequired to conquer Spain.', 'The shepherd Viriathus made guerilla warfare\\non them in the mountains of Portugal (149-139), overwhelmed five armies,\\nand compelled even a consul to treat for peace; the Senate got rid of him by\\nassassination. Against the single town of Numantia it was necessary to send Scipio, the\\nbest general of Rome. The little and obscure peoples of Corsica, of Sardinia, and of the mountains\\nof Genoa (the Ligurians) were always reviving the war with Rome.', 'But the most indomitable of all were the Gauls. Occupying the whole of the\\nvalley of the Po, they threw themselves on Italy to the south. One of their\\nbands had taken Rome in 390.', 'Their big white bodies, their long red\\nmustaches, their blue eyes, their savage yells terrified the Roman soldiers. As soon as their approach was learned, consternation seized Rome, and the\\nSenate proclaimed the levy of the whole army (they called this the \"Gallic\\ntumult\"). These wars were the bloodiest but the shortest; the first (225-222)\\ngave to the Romans all Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy); the second (120),\\nthe Rhone lands (Languedoc, Provence, DauphinÃ©); the third (58-51), all the\\nrest of Gaul.', 'ROMAN WARFARE\\nThe Triumph. â€”When a general has won a great victory, the Senate permits\\nhim as a signal honor to celebrate the triumph. This is a religious\\nprocession to the temple of Jupiter.', 'The magistrates and senators march at\\nthe head; then come the chariots filled with booty, the captives chained by\\nthe feet, and, at last, on a golden car drawn by four horses, the victorious\\ngeneral crowned with laurel. His soldiers follow him singing songs with\\nthe solemn refrain \"Io, Triomphe. \" The procession traverses the city in\\nfestal attire and ascends to the Capitol: there the victor lays down his laurel\\non the knees of Jupiter and thanks him for giving victory.', 'After the\\nceremony the captives are imprisoned, or, as in the case of Vercingetorix,\\nbeheaded, or, like Jugurtha, cast into a dungeon to die of hunger. The\\ntriumph of Ã†milius Paullus, conqueror of Macedon, lasted for three days. The first day witnessed a procession of 250 chariots bearing pictures and\\nstatues, the second the trophies of weapons and 25 casks of silver, the third\\nthe vases of gold and 120 sacrificial bulls.', 'At the rear walked King Perseus,\\nclad in black, surrounded by his followers in chains and his three young\\nchildren who extended their hands to the people to implore their pity. Booty. â€”In the wars of antiquity the victor took possession of everything\\nthat had belonged to the vanquished, not only of the arms and campbaggage, but of the treasure, the movable property, beasts of the hostile\\npeople, the men, women, and children.', 'At Rome the booty did not belong\\nto the soldiers but to the people. The prisoners were enslaved, the property\\nwas sold and the profits of the sale turned into the public chest. And so\\nevery war was a lucrative enterprise.', 'The kings of Asia had accumulated\\nenormous treasure and this the Roman generals transported to Rome. The\\nvictor of Carthage deposited in the treasury more than 100,000 pounds of\\nsilver; the conqueror of Antiochus 140,000 pounds of silver and 1,000\\npounds of gold without counting the coined metals; the victor over Persia\\nremitted 120,000,000 sesterces. The Allies of Rome.', 'â€”The ancient world was divided among a great\\nnumber of kings, little peoples, and cities that hated one another. They\\nnever united for resistance and so Rome absorbed them one by one. Those whom she did not attack remained neutral and indifferent; often\\nthey even united with the Romans.', 'In the majority of her wars Rome did\\nnot fight alone, but had the assistance of allies: against Carthage, the king\\nof Numidia; against the king of Macedon, the Ã†tolians; against the king of\\nSyria, the Rhodians. In the east many kings proudly assumed the title of\\n\"Ally of the Roman People. \" In the countries divided into small states, some\\npeoples called in the Romans against their neighbors, receiving the Roman\\narmy, furnishing it with provisions, and guiding it to the frontiers of the\\nhostile country.', 'And so in Gaul it was Marseilles that introduced the\\nRomans into the valley of the Rhone; it was the people of Autun (the Ã†dui)\\nwho permitted them to establish themselves in the heart of the land. Motives of Conquest. â€”The Romans did not from the first have the purpose\\nto conquer the world.', 'Even after winning Italy and Carthage they waited a\\ncentury before subjecting the Orient which really laid itself at their feet. They conquered, it appears, without predetermined plan, and because they\\nall had interest in conquest. The magistrates who were leaders of the\\narmies saw in conquest a means of securing the honors of the triumph and\\nthe surest instrument for making themselves popular.', 'The most powerful\\nstatesmen in Rome, Papirius, Fabius, the two Scipios, Cato, Marius, Sulla,\\nPompey, CÃ¦sar, and Crassus, were victorious generals. The nobles who\\ncomposed the Senate gained by the increase of Roman subjects, and with\\nthese they allied themselves as governors to receive their homage and their\\npresents. For the knightsâ€”that is to say, the bankers, the merchants, and\\nthe contractorsâ€”every new conquest was a new land to exploit.', 'The people\\nitself profited by the booty taken from the enemy. After the treasure of the\\nking of Macedon was deposited in the public chest, taxes were finally\\nabolished. As for the soldiers, as soon as war was carried into rich lands,\\nthey received immense sums from their general, to say nothing of what\\nthey took from the vanquished.', 'The Romans conquered the world less for\\nglory than for the profits of war. EFFECTS OF ROMAN CONQUEST\\nThe Empire of the Roman People. â€”Rome subjected all the lands around\\nthe Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor.', 'These countries were not\\nannexed, their inhabitants did not become citizens of Rome, nor their\\nterritory Roman territory. They remained aliens entering simply into the\\nRoman empire, that is, under the domination of the Roman people. In just\\nthe same way today the Hindoos are not citizens but subjects of England;\\nIndia is a part, not of England, but of the British Empire.', 'The Public Domain. â€”When a conquered people asked peace, this is the\\nformula which its deputies were expected to pronounce: \"We surrender to\\nyou the people, the town, the fields, the waters, the gods of the boundaries,\\nand movable property; all things which belonged to the gods and to men\\nwe deliver to the power of the Roman people. \" By this act, the Roman\\npeople became the proprietor of everything that the vanquished possessed,\\neven of their persons.', 'Sometimes it sold the inhabitants into slavery:\\nÃ†milius Paullus sold 150,000 Epeirots who surrendered to him. Ordinarily\\nRome left to the conquered their liberty, but their territory was\\nincorporated into the domain of the Roman people. Of this land three equal\\nparts were made:\\n1.', 'A part of their lands was returned to the people, but on condition that\\nthey pay a tribute in money or in grain, and Rome reserved the right of\\nrecalling the land at will. 2. The fields and pastures were farmed out to publicans.', '3. Some of the uncultivated land was resigned to the first occupant, every\\nRoman citizen having the right of settling there and of cultivating it. Agrarian Laws.', 'â€”The Agrarian Laws which deeply agitated Rome were\\nconcerned with this public domain. No Roman had leave to expel the\\npossessors, for the boundaries of these domains were gods (Termini) and\\nreligious scruple prevented them from being disturbed. By the Agrarian\\nLaws the people resumed the lands of the public domain which they\\ndistributed to citizens as property.', 'Legally the people had the right to do\\nthis, since all the domain belonged to them. But for some centuries certain\\nsubjects or citizens had been permitted to enjoy these lands; at last they\\nregarded them as their own property; they bequeathed them, bought and\\nsold them. To take these from the occupants would suddenly ruin a\\nmultitude of people.', 'In Italy especially, if this were done, all the people of a\\ncity would be expelled. Thus Augustus deprived the inhabitants of Mantua\\nof the whole of their territory; Vergil was among the victims, but, thanks to\\nhis verse, he obtained the return of his domain, while the other proprietors\\nwho were not poets remained in exile. These lands thus recovered were\\nsometimes distributed to poor citizens of Rome, but most frequently to old\\nsoldiers.', 'Sulla bestowed lands on 120,000 veterans at the expense of the\\npeople of Etruria. The Agrarian Laws were a menace to all the subjects of\\nRome, and it was one of the benefits conferred by the emperors that they\\nwere abolished. CHAPTER XXI\\nTHE CONQUERED PEOPLES\\nTHE PROVINCIALS\\nThe Provinces.', 'â€”The inhabitants of conquered countries did not enter into\\nRoman citizenship, but remained strangers (peregrini), while yet subjects\\nof the Roman empire. They were to pay tributeâ€”the tithe of their crops, a\\ntax in silver, a capitation tax. They must obey Romans of every order.', 'But\\nas the Roman people could not itself administer the province, it sent a\\nmagistrate in its place with the mission of governing. The country subject\\nto a governor was called province (which signifies mission). At the end of the republic (in 46), there were seventeen provinces: ten in\\nEurope, five in Asia, two in Africaâ€”the majority of these very large.', 'Thus\\nthe entire territory of Gaul constituted but four provinces, and Spain but\\ntwo. \"The provinces,\" said Cicero, \"are the domains of the Roman people\"â€”\\nif it made all these peoples subjects, it was not for their advantage, but for\\nits own. Its aim was not to administer, but to exploit them.', 'The Proconsuls. â€”For the administration of a province the Roman people\\nalways appointed a magistrate, consul or prÃ¦tor, who was just finishing\\nthe term of his office, and whose prerogative it prolonged. The proconsul,\\nlike the consul, had absolute power and he could exercise it to his fancy, for\\nhe was alone in his province; there were no other magistrates to dispute the\\npower with him, no tribunes of the people to veto his acts, no senate to\\nwatch him.', 'He alone commanded the troops, led them to battle, and posted\\nthem where he wished. He sat in his tribunal (prÃ¦torium), condemning to\\nfine, imprisonment, or death. He promulgated decrees which had the force\\nof law.', 'He was the sole authority over himself for he was in himself the\\nincarnation of the Roman people. Tyranny and Oppression of the Proconsuls. â€”This governor, whom no one\\nresisted, was a true despot.', 'He made arrests, cast into prison, beat with\\nrods, or executed those who displeased him. The following is one of a\\nthousand of these caprices of the governor as a Roman orator relates it: \"At\\nlast the consul came to Termini, where his wife took a fancy to bathe in the\\nmen\\'s bath. All the men who were bathing there were driven out The wife\\nof the consul complained that it had not been done quickly enough and\\nthat the baths were not well prepared.', 'The consul had a post set up in a\\npublic place, brought to it one of the most eminent men of the city, stripped\\nhim of his garments, and had him beaten with rods. \"\\nThe proconsul drew from the province as much money as he wanted; thus\\nhe regarded it as his private property. Means were not wanting to exploit\\nit.', 'He plundered the treasuries of the cities, removed the statues and jewels\\nstored in the temples, and made requisitions on the rich inhabitants for\\nmoney or grain. As he was able to lodge troops where he pleased, the cities\\npaid him money to be exempt from the presence of the soldiers. As he\\ncould condemn to death at will, individuals gave him security-money.', 'If he\\ndemanded an object of art or even a sum of money, who would dare to\\nrefuse him? The men of his escort imitated his example, pillaging under his\\nname, and even under his protection. The governor was in haste to\\naccumulate his wealth as it was necessary that he make his fortune in one\\nyear. After he returned to Rome, another came who recommenced the\\nwhole process.', 'There was, indeed, a law that prohibited every governor\\nfrom accepting a gift, and a tribunal (since 149) expressly for the crime of\\nextortion. But this tribunal was composed of nobles and Roman knights\\nwho would not condemn their compatriot, and the principal result of this\\nsystem was, according to the remark of Cicero, to compel the governor to\\ntake yet more plunder from the province in order to purchase the judges of\\nthe tribunal. It cannot surprise one that the term \"proconsul\" came to be a synonym for\\ndespot.', 'Of these brigands by appointment the most notorious was Verres,\\nproprÃ¦tor of Sicily, since Cicero from political motives pronounced against\\nhim seven orations which have made him famous. But it is probable that\\nmany others were as bad as he. The Publicans.', 'â€”In every province the Roman people had considerable\\nrevenuesâ€”the customs, the mines, the imposts, the grain-lands, and the\\npastures. These were farmed out to companies of contractors who were\\ncalled publicans. These men bought from the state the right of collecting\\nthe impost in a certain place, and the provincials had to obey them as the\\nrepresentatives of the Roman people.', 'And so in every province there were\\nmany companies of publicans, each with a crowd of clerks and collectors. These people carried themselves as masters, extorted more than was due\\nthem, reduced the debtors to misery, sometimes selling them as slaves. In\\nAsia they even exiled the inhabitants without any pretext.', 'When Marius\\nrequired the king of Bithynia to furnish him with soldiers, the king replied\\nthat, thanks to the publicans, he had remaining as citizens only women,\\nchildren, and old people. The Romans were well informed of these\\nexcesses. Cicero wrote to his brother, then a governor, \"If you find the\\nmeans of satisfying the publicans without letting the provincials be\\ndestroyed, it is because you have the attributes of a god.', '\" But the publicans\\nwere judged in the tribunals and the proconsuls themselves obeyed them. Scaurus, the proconsul of Asia, a man of rigid probity, wished to prevent\\nthem from pillaging his province; on his return to Rome they had him\\naccused and condemned. The publicans drove to extremities even the peaceable and submissive\\ninhabitants of the Orient: in a single night, at the order of Mithradates,\\n100,000 Romans were massacred.', 'A century later, in the time of Christ, the\\nword \"publican\" was synonymous with thief. The Bankers. â€”The Romans had heaped up at home the silver of the\\nconquered countries.', 'And so silver was very abundant in Rome and scarce\\nin the provinces. At Rome one could borrow at four or five per cent. ; in the\\nprovinces not less than twelve per cent.', 'was charged. The bankers\\nborrowed money in Rome and loaned it in the provinces, especially to\\nkings or to cities. When the exhausted peoples could not return the\\nprincipal and the interest, the bankers imitated the procedure of the\\npublicans.', 'In 84 the cities of Asia made a loan to pay an enormous warlevy; fourteen years later, the interest alone had made the debt amount to\\nsix times the original amount. The bankers compelled the cities to sell even\\ntheir objects of art; parents sold even their children. Some years later one of\\nthe most highly esteemed Romans of his time, Brutus, the Stoic, loaned to\\nthe city of Salamis in Cyprus a sum of money at forty-eight per cent.', 'interest (four per cent. a month). Scaptius, his business manager,\\ndemanded the sum with interest; the city could not pay; Scaptius then went\\nin search of the proconsul Appius, secured a squadron of cavalry and came\\nto Salamis to blockade the senate in its hall of assembly; five senators died\\nof famine.', 'Defencelessness of the Provincials. â€”The provincials had no redress against\\nall these tyrants. The governor sustained the publicans, and the Roman\\narmy and people sustained the governor.', 'Admit that a Roman citizen could\\nenter suit against the plunderers of the provinces: a governor was\\ninviolable and could not be accused until he had given up his office; while\\nhe held his office there was nothing to do but to watch him plunder. If he\\nwere accused on his return to Rome, he appeared before a tribunal of\\nnobles and of publicans who were more interested to support him than to\\nrender justice to the provincials. If, perchance, the tribunal condemned\\nhim, exile exempted him from all further penalty and he betook himself to\\na city of Italy to enjoy his plunder.', 'This punishment was nothing to him\\nand was not even a loss to him. And so the provincials preferred to\\nappease their governor by submission. They treated him like a king,\\nflattered him, sent presents, and raised statues to him.', 'Often, indeed, in\\nAsia they raised altars to him, built temples to him, and adored him as a\\ngod. SLAVERY\\nThe Sale of Slaves. â€”Every prisoner of war, every inhabitant of a captured\\ncity belonged to the victor.', 'If they were not killed, they were enslaved. Such was the ancient custom and the Romans exercised the right to the full. Captives were treated as a part of the booty and were therefore either sold\\nto slave-merchants who followed the army or, if taken to Rome, were put\\nup at auction.', 'After every war thousands of captives, men and women,\\nwere sold as slaves. Children born of slave mothers would themselves be\\nslaves. Thus it was the conquered peoples who furnished the slave-supply\\nfor the Romans.', 'Condition of the Slave. â€”The slave belonged to a master, and so was\\nregarded not as a person but as a piece of property. He had, then, no rights;\\nhe could not be a citizen or a proprietor; he could be neither husband nor\\nfather.', '\"Slave marriages!\" says a character in a Roman comedy;\"A slave\\ntakes a wife; it is contrary to the custom of every people. \" The master has\\nfull right over his slave; he sends him where he pleases, makes him work\\naccording to his will, even beyond his strength, ill feeds him, beats him,\\ntortures him, kills him without accounting to anybody for it. The slave\\nmust submit to all the whims of his master; the Romans declare, even, that\\nhe is to have no conscience, his only duty is blind obedience.', 'If he resists, if\\nhe flees, the state assists the master to subdue or recover him; the man who\\ngives refuge to a fugitive slave renders himself liable to the charge of theft,\\nas if he had taken an ox or a horse belonging to another. Number of Slaves. â€”Slaves were far more numerous than free men.', 'Rich\\ncitizens owned 10,000 to 20,000 of them, some having enough of them to\\nconstitute a real army. We read of CÃ¦cilius Claudius Isidorius who had\\nonce been a slave and came to possess more than 4,000 slaves. Horace, who\\nhad seven slaves, speaks of his modest patrimony.', 'Having but three was in\\nRome a mark of poverty. Urban Slaves. â€”The Roman nobles, like the Orientals of our day, delighted\\nin surrounding themselves with a crowd of servants.', 'In a great Roman\\nhouse lived hundreds of slaves, organized for different services. There\\nwere slaves to care for the furniture, for the silver plate, for the objects of\\nart; slaves of the wardrobe, valets and chambermaids, the troop of cooks,\\nthe slaves of the bath, the master of the house and his aids, the slaves to\\nescort the master and mistress on the street, the litter-carriers, coachmen\\nand grooms, secretaries, readers, copyists, physicians, teachers, actors,\\nmusicians, artisans of every kind, for in every great house grain was\\nground, flax was spun, and garments were woven. Others, gathered in\\nworkshops, manufactured objects which the master sold to his profit.', 'Others were hired out as masons or as sailors; Crassus had 500 carpenterslaves. These classes of slaves were called \"slaves of the city. \"\\nRural Slaves.', 'â€”Every great domain was tilled by a band of slaves. They\\nwere the laborers, the shepherds, the vine-dressers, the gardeners, the\\nfishermen, grouped together in squads of ten. An overseer, himself a slave,\\nsuperintended them.', 'The proprietor made it a matter to produce\\neverything on his lands: \"He buys nothing; everything that he consumes he\\nraises at home,\" this is the compliment paid to the rich. The Roman,\\ntherefore, kept a great number of country-slaves, as they were called. A\\nRoman domain had a strong resemblance to a village; indeed it was called\\na \"villa.', '\" The name has been preserved: what the French call \"ville\" since\\nthe Middle Ages is only the old Roman domain increased in size. Treatment of Slaves. â€”The kind of treatment the slaves received depended\\nentirely on the character of the master.', 'Some enlightened and humane\\nmasters may be enumerated, such as Cicero, Seneca, and Pliny, who fed\\ntheir slaves well, talked with them, sometimes had them sit at table with\\nthem, and permitted them to have families and small fortunes (the\\npeculium). But other masters are mentioned who treated their slaves as animals,\\npunished them cruelly, and even had them put to death for a whim. Examples of these are not lacking.', 'Vedius Pollio, a freedman of Augustus,\\nused to keep some lampreys in his fish-pond: when one of his slaves\\ncarelessly broke a vase, he had him thrown into the fish-pond as food for\\nthe lampreys. The philosopher Seneca paints in the following words the\\nviolent cruelty of the masters: \"If a slave coughs or sneezes during a meal,\\nif he pursues the flies too slowly, if he lets a key fall noisily lo the floor, we\\nfall into a great rage. If he replies with too much spirit, if his countenance\\nshows ill humor, have we any right to have him flogged? Often we strike\\ntoo hard and shatter a limb or break a tooth.', '\" The philosopher Epictetus,\\nwho was a slave, had had his ankle fractured in this way by his master. Women were no more humane. Ovid, in a compliment paid to a woman,\\nsays, \"Many times she had her hair dressed in my presence, but never did\\nshe thrust her needle into the arm of the serving-woman.', '\"\\nPublic opinion did not condemn these cruelties. Juvenal represents a\\nwoman angry at one of her slaves. \"Crucify him,\" says she.', '\"By what crime\\nhas the slave merited this punishment? Blockhead! Is a slave, then, a man?\\nIt may be that he has done nothing. I wish it, I order it, my will is reason\\nenough. \"\\nThe law was no milder than custom.', 'As late as the first century after Christ,\\nwhen a master was assassinated in his house, all the slaves were put to\\ndeath. When some wished to abolish this law, Thraseas, one of the\\nphilosophers of high repute, rose to address the Senate to demand that the\\nlaw be maintained. The Ergastulum.', 'â€”A subterranean prison, lighted by narrow windows so\\nhigh that they could not be reached by the hand, was called the\\nergastulum. The slaves who had displeased their master spent the night\\nthere; during the day they were sent to work loaded with heavy chains of\\niron. Many were branded with a red-hot iron.', 'The Mill. â€”The ancients had no mills run by machinery; they had the grain\\nground by slaves with hand-mills. It was the most difficult kind of work\\nand was usually inflicted as a punishment.', 'The mill of antiquity was like a\\nconvict-prison. \"There,\" says Plautus, \"moan the wicked slaves who are fed\\non polenta; there resound the noise of whips and the clanking of chains. \"\\nThree centuries later, in the second century, Apuleius the novelist, depicts\\nthe interior of a mill as follows: \"Gods! what poor shrunken up men! with\\nwhite skin striped with blows of the whip,.', 'they wear only the shreds of a\\ntunic; bent forward, head shaved, the feet held in a chain, the body\\ndeformed by the heat of the fire, the eyelids eaten away by the fumes,\\neverything covered with grain-dust. \"\\nCharacter of the Slaves. â€”Subjected to crushing labor or to enforced\\nidleness, always under the threat of the whip or of torture, slaves became,\\naccording to their nature, either melancholy and savage, or lazy and\\nsubservient.', 'The most energetic of them committed suicide; the others led a\\nlife that was merely mechanical. \"The slave,\" said Cato the Elder, \"ought\\nalways to work or to sleep. \" The majority of them lost all sense of honor.', 'And so they used to call a mean act \"servile,\" that is, like a slave. Slave Revolts. â€”The slaves did not write and so we do not know from their\\nown accounts what they thought of their masters.', 'But the masters felt\\nthemselves surrounded by hate. Pliny the Younger, learning that a master\\nwas to be assassinated at the bath by his slaves, made this reflection, \"This\\nis the peril under which we all live. \" \"More Romans,\" says another writer,\\n\"have fallen victims to the hate of their slaves than to that of tyrants.', '\"\\nAt different times slave revolts flamed up (the servile wars), almost always\\nin Sicily and south Italy where slaves were armed to guard the herds. The\\nmost noted of these wars was the one under Spartacus. A band of seventy\\ngladiators, escaping from Capua, plundered a chariot loaded with arms,\\nand set themselves to hold the country.', 'The slaves escaped to them in\\ncrowds to unite their fortunes with theirs, and soon they became an army. The slaves defeated three Roman armies sent in succession against them. Their chief Spartacus wished to traverse the whole peninsula of Italy in\\norder to return to Thrace, from which country he had been brought as a\\nprisoner of war to serve as a gladiator.', 'But at last these ill-disciplined\\nbands were shattered by the army of Crassus. The revolutionists were all\\nput to death. Rome now prohibited the slaves from carrying arms\\nthereafter, and it is reported that a shepherd was once executed for having\\nkilled a boar with a spear.', 'Admission to Citizenship. â€”Rome treated its subjects and its slaves\\nbrutally, but it did not drive them out, as the Greek cities did. The alien could become a Roman citizen by the will of the Roman people,\\nand the people often accorded this favor, sometimes they even bestowed it\\nupon a whole people at once.', 'They created the Latins citizens at one stroke;\\nin 89 it was the turn of the Italians; in 46 the people of Cisalpine Gaul\\nentered the body of citizens. All the inhabitants of Italy thus became the\\nequals of the Romans. The slave could be manumitted by his master and soon became a citizen.', 'This is the reason why the Roman people, gradually exhausting\\nthemselves, were renewed by accessions from the subjects and the slaves. The number of the citizens was increased at every census; it rose from\\n250,000 to 700,000. The Roman city, far from emptying itself as did Sparta,\\nreplenished itself little by little from all those whom it had conquered.', 'CHAPTER XXII\\nTRANSFORMATION OF LIFE IN ROME\\nGreek and Oriental Influence. â€”Conquest gave the Romans a clearer view\\nof the Greeks and Orientals. Thousands of foreigners brought to Rome as\\nslaves, or coming thither to make their fortune, established themselves in\\nthe city as physicians, professors, diviners, or actors.', 'Generals, officers and\\nsoldiers lived in the midst of Asia, and thus the Romans came to know the\\ncustoms and the new beliefs and gradually adopted them. This\\ntransformation had its beginning with the first Macedonian war (about 200\\nB. C.', '), and continued until the end of the empire. CHANGES IN RELIGION\\nThe Greek Gods. â€”The Roman gods bore but a slight resemblance to the\\nGreek gods, even in name; yet in the majority of the divinities of Rome the\\nGreeks recognized or believed they recognized their own.', 'The Roman gods\\nup to that time had neither precise form nor history; this rendered\\nconfusion all the easier. Every Roman god was represented under the form\\nof a Greek god and a history was made of the adventures of this god. The Latin Jupiter was confounded with the Greek Zeus; Juno with Hera;\\nMinerva, the goddess of memory, with Pallas, goddess of wisdom; Diana,\\nfemale counterpart of Janus, unites with Artemis, the brilliant huntress;\\nHercules, the god of the enclosure, was assimilated to Herakles, the victor\\nover monsters.', 'Thus Greek mythology insinuated itself under Latin names,\\nand the gods of Rome found themselves transformed into Greek gods. The\\nfusion was so complete that we have preserved the custom of designating\\nthe Greek gods by their Latin names; we still call Artemis Diana, and Pallas\\nMinerva. The Bacchanals.', 'â€”The Greeks had adopted an oriental god, Bacchus, the\\ngod of the vintage, and the Romans began to adore him also. The\\nworshippers of Bacchus celebrated his cult at night and in secret. Only the\\ninitiated were admitted to the mysteries of the Bacchanals, who swore not\\nto reveal any of the ceremonies.', 'A woman, however, dared to denounce to\\nthe Senate the Bacchanalian ceremonies that occurred in Rome in 186. The\\nSenate made an inquiry, discovered 7,000 persons, men and women, who\\nhad participated in the mysteries, and had them put to death. Oriental Superstitions.', 'â€”Already in 220 there was in Rome a temple of the\\nEgyptian god Serapis. The Senate ordered it to be demolished. As no\\nworkman dared to touch it, the consul himself had to come and beat down\\nthe doors with blows of an axe.', 'Some years after, in 205, during the war with Hannibal, it was the Senate\\nitself that sent an ambassador to Asia Minor to seek the goddess Cybele. The Great Mother (as she was called) was represented by a black stone, and\\nthis the envoys of the Senate brought in great pomp and installed in Rome. Her priests followed her and paced the streets to the sound of fifes and\\ncymbals, clad in oriental fashion, and begging from door to door.', 'Later, Italy was filled with Chaldean sorcerers. The mass of the people\\nwere not the only ones to believe in these diviners. When the Cimbri\\nmenaced Rome (104), Martha, a prophetess of Syria, came to the Senate to\\noffer it victory over the barbarians; the Senate drove her out, but the\\nRoman women brought her to the camp, and Marius, the general in chief,\\nkept her by him and consulted her to the end of the war.', 'Sulla, likewise,\\nhad seen in vision the goddess of Cappadocia and it was on her advice that\\nhe took his way to Italy. Sceptics. â€”Not only priests and diviners came to Rome, but also\\nphilosophers who scoffed at the old religion.', 'The best known of these,\\nCarneades, the ambassador of the Athenians, spoke in Rome in public, and\\nthe youth of Rome came in crowds to hear him. The Senate bade him leave\\nthe city. But the philosophers continued to teach in the schools of Athens\\nand Rhodes, and it was the fashion to send the Roman youth thither for\\ninstruction.', 'About the third century before Christ Euhemerus, a Greek, had\\nwritten a book to prove that there were no gods; the gods, he said, were\\nonly men of ancient times who had been deified; Jupiter himself had been a\\nking of Crete. This book had a great success and was translated into Latin\\nby the poet Ennius. The nobles of Rome were accustomed to mock at their\\ngods, maintaining only the cult of the old religion.', 'The higher Roman\\nsociety was for a century at once superstitious and sceptical. CHANGES IN MANNERS\\nThe Old Customs. â€”The old Romans had for centuries been diligent and\\nrude husbandmen, engaged in cultivating their fields, in fighting, and in\\nfulfilling the ceremonies of their religion.', 'Their ideal was the grave man. Cincinnatus, they said, was pushing his plough when the deputies of the\\nSenate came to offer him the dictatorship. Fabricius had of plate only a cup\\nand a salt-cellar of silver.', 'Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Samnites,\\nwas sitting on a bench eating some beans in a wooden bowl when the\\nenvoys of the Samnites presented themselves before him to offer him a\\nbribe. \"Go and tell the Samnites,\" said he, \"that Curius prefers commanding\\nthose who have gold to having it himself. \" These are some of the anecdotes\\nthat they used to tell about the generals of the olden time.', 'True or false,\\nthese legends exhibit the ideas that were current in Rome at a later time\\nregarding the ancient Romans. Cato the Elder. â€”At the time when manners were changing, one man made\\nhimself notable by his attachment to the \"customs of the fathers.', '\" This was\\nCato. He was born in 232 in the little village of Tusculum and had spent his\\nyouth in manual labor. Entering the army, according to the usage of the\\ntime, at the age of seventeen, he fought in all the campaigns against\\nHannibal.', 'He was not noble, but he made himself popular by his energy,\\nhis probity, and his austerity. He passed through the whole course of\\npolitical honorsâ€”quÃ¦stor, Ã¦dile, prÃ¦tor, consul, and censor. He showed\\nhimself everywhere, like the old Romans, rude, stern, and honest.', 'As\\nquÃ¦stor he remonstrated with the consul about his expenses; but the\\nconsul, who was Scipio, replied to him, \"I have no need of so exact a\\nquÃ¦stor. \" As prÃ¦tor in Sardinia, he refused the money that was offered\\nhim by the province for the expenses of entertainment. As consul, he spoke\\nwith vigor for the Oppian law which prohibited Roman women from\\nwearing costly attire; the women put it off, and the law was abrogated.', \"Sent to command the army of Spain, Cato took 400 towns, securing\\nimmense treasure which he turned into the public chest; at the moment of\\nembarking, he sold his horse to save the expenses of transportation. As\\ncensor, he erased from the senate-list many great persons on the ground of\\ntheir extravagance; he farmed the taxes at a very high price and taxed at\\nten times their value the women's habits, jewels, and conveyances. Having\\nobtained the honor of a triumph, he withdrew to the army in Macedonia as\\na simple officer.\", 'All his life he fought with the nobles of the new type, extravagant and\\nelegant. He \"barked\" especially at the Scipios, accusing them of embezzling\\nstate moneys. In turn he was forty-four times made defendant in court, but\\nwas always acquitted.', 'On his farm Cato labored with his slaves, ate with them, and when he had\\nto correct them, beat them with his own hand. In his treatise on\\nAgriculture, written for his son, he has recorded all the old axioms of the\\nRoman peasantry. He considered it to be a duty to become rich.', '\"A\\nwidow,\" he said, \"can lessen her property; a man ought to increase his. He\\nis worthy of fame and inspired of the gods who gains more than he\\ninherits. \" Finding that agriculture was not profitable enough, he invested in\\nmerchant ships; he united with fifty associates and all together constructed\\nfifty ships of commerce, that each might have a part in the risks and the\\nprofits.', 'A good laborer, a good soldier, a foe to luxury, greedy of gain, Cato\\nwas the type of the Roman of the old stock. The New Manners. â€”Many Romans on the contrary, especially the nobles,\\nadmired and imitated the foreigners.', 'At their head were the generals who\\nhad had a nearer view of Greece and the Orientâ€”Scipio, conqueror of the\\nking of Syria, Flamininus and Ã†milius Paullus, victors over the kings of\\nMacedon, later Lucullus, conqueror of the king of Armenia. They were\\ndisgusted with the mean and gross life of their ancestors, and adopted a\\nmore luxurious and agreeable mode of living. Little by little all the nobles,\\nall the rich followed their example; one hundred and fifty years later in\\nItaly all the great were living in Greek or oriental fashion.', 'Oriental Luxury. â€”In the East the Romans found models in the royal\\nsuccessors of Alexander, possessors of enormous wealth; for all the\\ntreasure that was not employed in paying mercenaries was squandered by\\nthe court. These oriental kings indulged their vanity by displaying\\ngleaming robes, precious stones, furniture of silver, golden plate; by\\nsurrounding themselves with a multitude of useless servants, by casting\\nmoney to the people who were assembled to admire them.', 'The Romans, very vain and with artistic tastes but slightly developed, had\\na relish for this species of luxury. They had but little regard for beauty or\\nfor comfort, and had thought for nothing else than display. They had\\nhouses built with immense gardens adorned with statues, sumptuous\\nvillas projecting into the sea in the midst of enormous gardens.', 'They\\nsurrounded themselves with troops of slaves. They and their wives\\nsubstituted for linen garments those of gauze, silk, and gold. At their\\nbanquets they spread embroidered carpets, purple coverings, gold and\\nsilver plate.', 'Sulla had one hundred and fifty dishes of silver; the plate of\\nMarcus Drusus weighed 10,000 pounds. While the common people\\ncontinued to sit at table in accordance with old Italian custom, the rich\\nadopted the oriental usage of reclining on couches at their meals. At the\\nsame time was introduced the affected and costly cookery of the Eastâ€”\\nexotic fishes, brains of peacocks, and tongues of birds.', 'From the second century the extravagance was such that a consul who died\\nin 152 could say in his will: \"As true glory does not consist in vain pomp\\nbut in the merits of the dead and of one\\'s ancestors, I bid my children not to\\nspend on my funeral ceremonies more than a million as\" ($10,000). Greek Humanity. â€”In Greece the Romans saw the monuments, the statues,\\nand the pictures which had crowded their cities for centuries; they came to\\nknow their learned people and the philosophers.', 'Some of the Romans\\nacquired a taste for the beautiful and for the life of the spirit. The Scipios\\nsurrounded themselves with cultivated Greeks. Ã†milius Paullus asked\\nfrom all the booty taken by him from Macedon only the library of King\\nPerseus; he had his children taught by Greek preceptors.', 'It was then the\\nfashion in Rome to speak, and even to write in Greek. The nobles desired to\\nappear connoisseurs in painting and in sculpture; they imported statues by\\nthe thousand, the famous bronzes of Corinth, and they heaped these up in\\ntheir houses. Thus Verres possessed a whole gallery of objects of art which\\nhe had stolen in Sicily.', 'Gradually the Romans assumed a gloss of Greek art\\nand literature. This new culture was called \"humanity,\" as opposed to the\\n\"rusticity\" of the old Roman peasants. It was little else than gloss; the Romans had realized but slightly that\\nbeauty and truth were to be sought for their own sakes; art and science\\nalways remained objects of luxury and parade.', 'Even in the time of Cicero\\nthe soldier, the peasant, the politician, the man of affairs, the advocate were\\nalone regarded as truly occupied. Writing, composing, contributing to\\nscience, philosophy, or criticismâ€”all this was called \"being at leisure. \"\\nArtists and scholars were never regarded at Rome as the equals of the rich\\nmerchant.', 'Lucian, a Greek writer, said, \"If you would be a Pheidias, if you\\nwould make a thousand masterpieces, nobody will care to imitate you, for\\nas skilful as you are, you will always pass for an artisan, a man who lives\\nby the work of his hands. \"\\nLucullus. â€”Lucullus, the type of the new Roman, was born in 145 of a\\nnoble and rich family; thus he entered without difficulty into the course of\\npolitical honors.', 'From his first campaigns he was notable for his\\nmagnanimity to the vanquished. Become consul, he was placed at the head\\nof the army against Mithradates. He found the inhabitants of Asia\\nexasperated by the brigandage and the cruelties of the publicans, and gave\\nhimself to checking these excesses; he forbade, too, his soldiers pillaging\\nconquered towns.', 'In this way he drew to him the useless affection of the\\nAsiatics and the dangerous hate of the publicans and the soldiers. They\\nintrigued to have him recalled; he had then defeated Mithradates and was\\npursuing him with his ally, the king of Armenia; he came with a small\\narmy of 20,000 men to put to rout an immense multitude of barbarians. His\\ncommand was taken from him and given to Pompey, the favorite of the\\npublicans.', 'Lucullus then retired to enjoy the riches that he had accumulated in Asia. He had in the neighborhood of Rome celebrated gardens, at Naples a villa\\nconstructed in part in the sea, and at Tusculum a summer palace with a\\nwhole museum of objects of art. He spent the beautiful season at Tusculum\\nsurrounded by his friends, by scholars and men of letters, reading Greek\\nauthors, and discussing literature and philosophy.', 'Many anecdotes are told of the luxury of Lucullus. One day, being alone at\\ndinner, he found his table simpler than ordinary and reproached the cook,\\nwho excused himself by saying there was no guest present. \"Do you not\\nknow,\" replied his master, \"that Lucullus dines today with Lucullus?\"\\nAnother day he invited CÃ¦sar and Cicero to dine, who accepted on\\ncondition that he would make no change from his ordinary arrangements.', 'Lucullus simply said to a slave to have dinner prepared in the hall of\\nApollo. A magnificent feast was spread, the guests were astonished. Lucullus replied he had given no order, that the expense of his dinners was\\nregulated by the hall where he gave them; those of the hall of Apollo were\\nto cost not less than $10,000.', 'A prÃ¦tor who had to present a grand spectacle\\nasked Lucullus if he would lend him one hundred purple robes; he replied\\nby tendering two hundred. Lucullus remained the representative of the new manners, as Cato of the\\nold customs. For the ancients Cato was the virtuous Roman, Lucullus the\\ndegenerate Roman.', 'Lucullus, in effect, discarded the manners of his\\nancestors, and so acquired a broader, more elevated, and more refined\\nspirit, more humanity toward his slaves and his subjects. The New Education. â€”At the time when Polybius lived in Rome (before\\n150) the old Romans taught their children nothing else than to read.', 'The\\nnew Romans provided Greek instructors for their children. Some Greeks\\nopened in Rome schools of poesy, rhetoric, and music. The great families\\ntook sides between the old and new systems.', 'But there always remained a\\nprejudice against music and the dance; they were regarded as arts\\nbelonging to the stage, improper for a man of good birth. Scipio\\nÃ†milianus, the protector of the Greeks, speaks with indignation of a\\ndancing-school to which children and young girls of free birth resorted:\\n\"When it was told me, I could not conceive that nobles would teach such\\nthings to their children. But when some one took me to the dancing-school,\\nI saw there more than 500 boys and girls and, among the number a twelveyear-old child, a candidate\\'s son, who danced to the sound of castanets.', '\"\\nSallust, speaking of a Roman woman of little reputation, says, \"She played\\non the lyre and danced better than is proper for an honest woman. \"\\nThe New Status of Women. â€”The Roman women gave themselves with\\nenergy to the religions and the luxury of the East.', 'They flocked in crowds\\nto the Bacchanals and the mysteries of Isis. Sumptuary laws were made\\nagainst their fine garments, their litters, and their jewels, but these laws\\nhad to be abrogated and the women allowed to follow the example of the\\nmen. Noble women ceased to walk or to remain in their homes; they set out\\nwith great equipages, frequented the theatre, the circus, the baths, and the\\nplaces of assembly.', 'Idle and exceedingly ignorant, they quickly became\\ncorrupt. In the nobility, women of fine character became the exception. The\\nold discipline of the family fell to the ground.', 'The Roman law made the\\nhusband the master of his wife; but a new form of marriage was invented\\nwhich left the woman under the authority of her father and gave no power\\nto her husband. To make their daughter still more independent, her\\nparents gave her a dower. Divorce.', 'â€”Sometimes the husband alone had the right to repudiate his\\nwife, but the custom was that this right should be exercised only in the\\ngravest circumstances. The woman gained the right of leaving her\\nhusband, and so it became very easy to break a marriage. There was no\\nneed of a judgment, or even of a motive.', 'It was enough for the\\ndiscontented husband or wife to say to the other, \"Take what belongs to\\nyou, and return what is mine. \" After the divorce either could marry again. In the aristocracy, marriage came to be regarded as a passing union; Sulla\\nhad five wives, CÃ¦sar four, Pompey five, and Antony four.', 'The daughter\\nof Cicero had three husbands. Hortensius divorced his wife to give her to a\\nfriend. \"There are noble women,\" says Seneca, \"who count their age not by\\nthe years of the consuls, but by the husbands they have had; they divorce\\nto marry again, they marry to divorce again.', '\"\\nBut this corruption affected hardly more than the nobles of Rome and the\\nupstarts. In the families of Italy and the provinces the more serious\\nmanners of the old time still prevailed; but the discipline of the family\\ngradually slackened and the woman slowly freed herself from the\\ndespotism of her husband. CHAPTER XXIII\\nFALL OF THE REPUBLIC\\nDECADENCE OF REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS\\nDestruction of the Peasantry.', 'â€”The old Roman people consisted of small\\nproprietors who cultivated their own land. These honest and robust\\npeasants constituted at once the army and the assembly of the people. Though still numerous in 221 and during the Second Punic War, in 133\\nthere were no more of them.', 'Many without doubt had perished in the\\nforeign wars; but the special reason for their disappearance was that it had\\nbecome impossible for them to subsist. The peasants lived by the culture of grain. When Rome received the grain\\nof Sicily and Africa, the grain of Italy fell to so low a price that laborers\\ncould not raise enough to support their families and pay the military tax.', 'They were compelled to sell their land and this was bought by a rich\\nneighbor. Of many small fields he made a great domain; he laid the land\\ndown to grazing, and to protect his herds or to cultivate it he sent\\nshepherds and slave laborers. On the soil of Italy at that time there were\\nonly great proprietors and troops of slaves.', '\"Great domains,\" said Pliny the\\nElder, \"are the ruin of Italy. \"\\nIt was, in fact, the great domains that drove the free peasants from the\\ncountry districts. The old proprietor who sold his land could no longer\\nremain a farmer; he had to yield the place to slaves, and he himself\\nwandered forth without work.', '\"The majority of these heads of families,\"\\nsays Varro in his treatise on agriculture, \"have slipped within our walls,\\nleaving the scythe and the plough; they prefer clapping their hands at the\\ncircus to working in their fields and their vineyards. \" Tiberius Gracchus, a\\ntribune of the plebs, exclaimed in a moment of indignation, \"The wild\\nbeasts of Italy have at least their lairs, but the men who offer their blood for\\nItaly have only the light and the air that they breathe; they wander about\\nwithout shelter, without a dwelling, with their wives and their children. Those generals do but mock them who exhort them to fight for their tombs\\nand their temples.', 'Is there one of them who still possesses the sacred altar\\nof his house and the tomb of his ancestors? They are called the masters of\\nthe world while they have not for themselves a single foot of earth. \"\\nThe City Plebs. â€”While the farms were being drained, the city of Rome was\\nbeing filled with a new population.', 'They were the descendants of the\\nruined peasants whom misery had driven to the city; besides these, there\\nwere the freedmen and their children. They came from all the corners of\\nthe worldâ€”Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Asiatics, Africans, Spaniards,\\nGaulsâ€”torn from their homes, and sold as slaves; later freed by their\\nmasters and made citizens, they massed themselves in the city. It was an\\nentirely new people that bore the name Roman.', 'One day Scipio, the\\nconqueror of Carthage and of Numantia, haranguing the people in the\\nforum, was interrupted by the cries of the mob. \"Silence! false sons of Italy,\"\\nhe cried; \"do as you like; those whom I brought to Rome in chains will\\nnever frighten me even if they are no longer slaves. \" The populace\\npreserved quiet, but these \"false sons of Italy,\" the sons of the vanquished,\\nhad already taken the place of the old Romans.', 'This new plebeian order could not make a livelihood for itself, and so the\\nstate had to provide food for it. A beginning was made in 123 with\\nfurnishing corn at half price to all citizens, and this grain was imported\\nfrom Sicily and Africa. Since the year 63 corn was distributed gratuitously\\nand oil was also provided.', 'There were registers and an administration\\nexpressly for these distributions, a special service for furnishing provisions\\n(the Annona). In 46 CÃ¦sar found 320,000 citizens enrolled for these\\ndistributions. Electoral Corruption.', 'â€”This miserable and lazy populace filled the forum\\non election days and made the laws and the magistrates. The candidates\\nsought to win its favors by giving shows and public feasts, and by\\ndispensing provisions. They even bought votes.', 'This sale took place on a\\nlarge scale and in broad day; money was given to distributers who divided\\nit among the voters. Once the Senate endeavored to stop this trade; but\\nwhen Piso, the consul, proposed a law to prohibit the sale of suffrages, the\\ndistributers excited a riot and drove the consul from the forum. In the time\\nof Cicero no magistrate could be elected without enormous expenditures.', 'Corruption of the Senate. â€”Poverty corrupted the populace who formed\\nthe assemblies; luxury tainted the men of the old families who composed\\nthe Senate. The nobles regarded the state as their property and so divided\\namong themselves the functions of the state and intrigued to exclude the\\nrest of the citizens from them.', 'When Cicero was elected magistrate, he was\\nfor thirty years the first \"new man\" to enter the succession of offices. Accustomed to exercise power, some of the senators believed themselves to\\nbe above the law. When Scipio was accused of embezzlement, he refused\\neven to exonerate himself and said at the tribune, \"Romans, it was on this\\nday that I conquered Hannibal and the Carthaginians.', 'Follow me to the\\nCapitol to render thanks to the gods and to beseech them always to\\nprovide generals like myself. \"\\nTo support their pretensions at home, the majority of the nobles required a\\nlarge amount of money. Many used their power to get it for themselves:\\nsome sent as governors plundered the subjects of Rome; others compelled\\nforeign or hostile kings to pay for the peace granted them, or even for\\nletting their army be beaten.', 'It was in this way that Jugurtha bribed a\\nRoman general. Cited to Rome to answer for a murder, he escaped trial by\\nbuying up a tribune who forbade him to speak. It was related that in\\nleaving Rome he had said, \"O city for sale, if thou only couldst find a\\npurchaser!\"\\nCorruption of the Army.', 'â€”The Roman army was composed of small\\nproprietors who, when a war was finished, returned to the cultivation of\\ntheir fields. In becoming soldiers they remained citizens and fought only\\nfor their country. Marins began to admit to the legions poor citizens who\\nenrolled themselves for the purpose of making capital from their\\ncampaigns.', 'Soon the whole army was full of adventurers who went to war,\\nnot to perform their service, but to enrich themselves from the vanquished. One was no longer a soldier from a sense of duty, but as a profession. The soldiers enrolled themselves for twenty years; their time completed,\\nthey reÃ«ngaged themselves at higher pay and became veterans.', 'These\\npeople knew neither the Senate nor the laws; their obedience was only to\\ntheir general. To attach them to himself, the general distributed to them the\\nmoney taken from the vanquished. During the war against Mithradates\\nSulla lodged his men with the rich inhabitants of Asia; they lived as they\\nchose, they and their friends, receiving each sixteen drachmas a day.', 'These\\nfirst generals, Marius and Sulla, were still Roman magistrates. But soon\\nrich individuals like Pompey and Crassus drew the soldiers to their pay. In\\n78 at the death of Sulla there were four armies, levied entirely and\\ncommanded by simple citizens.', 'From that time there was no further\\nquestion of the legions of Rome, there were left only the legions of Pompey\\nor CÃ¦sar. THE REVOLUTION\\nNecessity of the Revolution. â€”The Roman people was no longer anything\\nbut an indigent and lazy multitude, the army only an aggregation of\\nadventurers.', 'Neither the assembly nor the legions obeyed the Senate, for\\nthe corrupt nobles had lost all moral authority, so that there was left but\\none real powerâ€”the army; there were no men of influence beside the\\ngenerals, and the generals had no longer any desire to obey. The\\ngovernment by the Senate, now no longer practicable, gave place to the\\ngovernment of the general. The Civil Wars.', 'â€”The revolution was inevitable, but it did not come at one\\nstroke; it required more than a hundred years to accomplish it. The Senate\\nresisted, but too weak itself to govern, it was strong enough to prevent\\ndomination by another power. The generals fought among themselves to\\nsee who should remain master.', 'For a century the Romans and their subjects\\nlived in the midst of riot and civil war. The Gracchi. â€”The first civil discord that blazed up in Rome was the\\ncontest of the Gracchi against the Senate.', 'The two brothers, Tiberius and\\nGaius Gracchus, were of one of the noblest families of Rome, but both\\nendeavored to take the government from the nobles who formed the Senate\\nby making themselves tribunes of the plebs. There was at that time, either\\nin Rome or in Italy, a crowd of citizens without means who desired a\\nrevolution; even among the rich the majority were of the class of the\\nknights, who complained that they had no part in the government. Tiberius\\nGracchus had himself named tribune of the plebs and sought to gain\\ncontrol of the government.', 'He proposed to the people an agrarian law. All\\nthe lands of the public domain occupied by individuals were to be resumed\\nby the state (with the exception of 500 acres for each one); these lands taken\\nby the state were to be distributed in small lots to poor citizens. The law\\nwas voted.', 'It caused general confusion regarding property, for almost all of\\nthe lands of the empire constituted a part of the public domain, but they\\nhad been occupied for a long time and the possessors were accustomed to\\nregard themselves as proprietors. Further, as the Romans had no registry of\\nthe lands, it was often very difficult to ascertain whether a domain were\\nprivate or public property. To direct these operations, Tiberius had three\\ncommissioners named on whom the people conferred absolute authority;\\nthey were Tiberius, his brother, and his father-in-law, and it was uncertain\\nwhether Tiberius had acted in the interest of the people, or simply to have\\na pretext for having power placed in his hands.', 'For a year he was master of\\nRome; but when he wished to be elected tribune of the plebs for the\\nsucceeding year, his enemies protested, as this was contrary to custom. A\\nriot followed. Tiberius and his friends seized the Capitol; the partisans of\\nthe Senate and their slaves, armed with clubs and fragments of benches,\\npursued them and despatched them (133).', 'Ten years later Gaius, the younger of the Gracchi, elected tribune of the\\nplebs (123), had the agrarian law voted anew, and established distributions\\nof corn to the poor citizens. Then, to destroy the power of the nobles, he\\nsecured a decree that the judges should be taken from among the knights. For two years Gaius dominated the government, but while he was absent\\nfrom the city conducting a colony of Roman citizens to Carthage the people\\nabandoned him.', 'On his return he could not be reÃ«lected. The consul armed\\nthe partisans of the Senate and marched against Gaius and his friends who\\nhad fled to the Aventine Hill. Gaius had himself killed by a slave; his\\nfollowers were massacred or executed in prison; their houses were razed\\nand their property confiscated.', 'Marius and Sulla. â€”The contests of the Gracchi and the Senate had been no\\nmore than riots in the streets of Rome, terminating in a combat between\\nbands hastily armed. The strife that followed was a succession of real wars\\nbetween regular armies, wars in Italy, wars in all the provinces.', 'From this\\ntime the party chiefs were no other than the generals. The first to use his army to secure obedience in Rome was Marius. He was\\nborn in Arpinum, a little town in the mountains, and was not of noble\\ndescent.', 'He had attained reputation as an officer in the army, and had been\\nelected tribune of the plebs, then prÃ¦tor, with the help of the nobles. He\\nturned against them and was elected consul and commissioned with the\\nwar against Jugurtha, king of Numidia, who had already fought several\\nRoman armies. It was then that Marius enrolled poor citizens for whom\\nmilitary service became a profession.', 'With his army Marius conquered\\nJugurtha and the barbarians, the Cimbri and Teutones, who had invaded\\nthe empire. He then returned to Rome where he had himself elected consul\\nfor the sixth time and now exercised absolute power. Two parties now took\\nform in Rome who called themselves the party of the people (the party of\\nMarius), and the party of the nobles (that of the Senate).', 'The partisans of Marius committed so many acts of violence that they\\nended by making him unpopular. Sulla, a noble, of the great family of the\\nCornelii, profited by this circumstance to dispute the power of Marius;\\nSulla was also a general. When the Italians rose against Rome to secure the\\nright of citizenship and levied great armies which marched almost to the\\ngates of the city, it was Sulla who saved Rome by fighting the Italians.', 'He became consul and was charged with the war against Mithradates, king\\nof Pontus, who had invaded Asia Minor and massacred all the Romans\\n(88). Marius in jealousy excited a riot in the city; Sulla departed, joined his\\narmy which awaited him in south Italy, then returned to Rome. Roman\\nreligion prohibited soldiers entering the city under arms; the consul even\\nbefore passing the gates had to lay aside his mantle of war and assume the\\ntoga.', 'Sulla was the first general who dared to violate this restriction. Marius took flight. But when Sulla had left for Asia, Marius came with an army of adventurers\\nand entered Rome by force (87).', 'Then commenced the proscriptions. The principal partisans of Sulla were outlawed, and command was given to\\nkill them anywhere they were met and to confiscate their goods. Marius\\ndied some months later; but his principal partisan, Cinna, continued to\\ngovern Rome and to put to death whomever he pleased.', 'During this time Sulla had conquered Mithradates and had assured the\\nloyalty of his soldiers by giving them the free pillage of Asia. He returned\\nwith his army (83) to Italy. His enemies opposed him with five armies, but\\nthese were defeated or they deserted.', 'Sulla entered Rome, massacred his\\nprisoners and overthrew the partisans of Marius. After some days of\\nslaughter he set himself to proceed regularly: he posted three lists of those\\nwhom he wished killed. \"I have posted now all those whom I can recall; I\\nhave forgotten many, but their names will be posted as the names occur to\\nme.', '\" Every proscribed manâ€”that is to say, every man whose name was on\\nthe list, was marked for death; the murderer who brought his head was\\nrewarded. The property of the proscribed was confiscated. Proscription\\nwas not the result of any trial but of the caprice of the general, and that too\\nwithout any warning.', 'Sulla thus massacred not only his enemies but the\\nrich whose property he coveted. It is related that a citizen who was\\nunaccustomed to politics glanced in passing at the list of proscriptions and\\nsaw his own name inscribed at the top of the list. \"Alas!\" he cried, \"my\\nAlban house has been the death of me!\" Sulla is said to have proscribed\\n1800 knights.', 'After having removed his enemies, he endeavored to organize a\\ngovernment in which all power should be in the hands of the Senate. He\\nhad himself named Dictator, an old title once given to generals in moments\\nof danger and which conferred absolute power. Sulla used the office to\\nmake laws which changed the entire constitution.', 'From that time all the\\njudges were to be taken from the Senate, no law could be discussed before\\nit had been accepted by the Senate, the right of proposing laws was taken\\nfrom the tribunes of the plebs. After these reforms Sulla abdicated his functions and retired to private life\\n(79). He knew he had nothing to fear, for he had established 100,000 of his\\nsoldiers in Italy.', 'Pompey and CÃ¦sar. â€”The Senate had recovered its power because Sulla\\nsaw fit to give it this, but it had not the strength to retain it if a general\\nwished again to seize it. The government of the Senate endured, however,\\nin appearance for more than thirty years; this was because there were\\nseveral generals and each prevented a rival from gaining all power.', 'At the death of Sulla four armies took the field: two obeyed the generals\\nwho were partisans of the Senate, Crassus and Pompey; two followed\\ngenerals who were adversaries of the Senate, Lepidus in Italy, and\\nSertorius in Spain. It is very remarkable that no one of these armies was\\nregular, no one of the generals was a magistrate and therefore had the right\\nto command troops; down to this time the generals had been consuls, but\\nnow they were individualsâ€”private persons; their soldiers came to them\\nnot to serve the interests of the state, but to profit at the expense of the\\ninhabitants. The armies of the enemies of the Senate were destroyed, and Crassus and\\nPompey, left alone, joined issues to control affairs.', 'They had themselves\\nelected consuls and Pompey received the conduct of two wars. He went to\\nAsia with a devoted army and was for several years the master of Rome;\\nbut as he was more the possessor of offices than of power, he changed\\nnothing in the government. It was during this time that CÃ¦sar, a young\\nnoble, made himself popular.', 'Pompey, Crassus, and CÃ¦sar united to\\ndivide the power between themselves.

Apotheosis of the Emperor. â€”As long as the emperor lived he was sole\\nmaster of the empire, since the Roman people had conveyed all its power\\nto him.', 'But at his death the Senate in the name of the people reviewed his\\nlife and passed judgment upon it. If he were condemned, all the acts which\\nhe had made were nullified, his statues thrown down, and his name\\neffaced from the monuments. If, on the contrary, his acts were ratified\\n(which almost always occurred), the Senate at the same time decreed that\\nthe deceased emperor should be elevated to the rank of the gods.', 'The\\nmajority of the emperors, therefore, became gods after their death. Temples\\nwere raised to them and priests appointed to render them worship. Throughout the empire there were temples dedicated to the god Augustus\\nand to the goddess Roma, and persons are known who performed the\\nfunctions of flamen (priest) of the divine Claudius, or of the divine\\nVespasian.', 'This practice of deifying the dead emperor was called\\nApotheosis. The word is Greek; the custom probably came from the Greeks\\nof the Orient. The Senate and the People.', 'â€”The Roman Senate remained what it had\\nalways beenâ€”the assembly of the richest and most eminent personages of\\nthe empire. To be a senator was still an eagerly desired honor; in speaking\\nof a great family one would say, \"a senatorial family. \" But the Senate,\\nrespected as it was, was now powerless, because the emperor could\\ndispense with it.', 'It was still the most distinguished body in the state, but it\\nwas no longer the master of the government. The emperor often pretended\\nto consult it, but he was not bound by its advice. The people had lost all its power since the assemblies (the Comitia) were\\nsuppressed in the reign of Tiberius.', 'The population of 2,000,000 souls\\ncrowded into Rome was composed only of some thousands of great lords\\nwith their slaves and a mob of paupers. Already the state had assumed the\\nburden of feeding the latter; the emperors continued to distribute grain to\\nthem, and supplemented this with donations of money (the congiarium). Augustus thus donated $140 apiece in nine different distributions, and\\nNero $50 in three.', 'At the same time to amuse this populace shows were\\npresented. The number of days regularly appointed for the shows under\\nthe republic had already amounted to 66 in the year; it had increased in a\\ncentury and a half, under Marcus Aurelius, to 135, and in the fourth\\ncentury to 175 (without counting supplementary days). These spectacles\\ncontinued each day from sunrise to sunset; the spectators ate their lunch in\\ntheir places.', 'This was a means used by the emperors for the occupation of\\nthe crowd. \"It is for your advantage, CÃ¦sar,\" said an actor to Augustus,\\n\"that the people engage itself with us. \" It was also a means for securing\\npopularity.', 'The worst emperors were among the most popular; Nero was\\nadored for his magnificent spectacles; the people refused to believe that he\\nwas dead, and for thirty years they awaited his return. The multitude of Rome no longer sought to govern; it required only to be\\namused and fed: in the forceful expression of Juvenalâ€”to be provided with\\nbread and the games of the circus (panem et circenses). The PrÃ¦torians.', 'â€”Under the republic a general was prohibited from\\nleading his army into the city of Rome. The emperor, chief of all the armies,\\nhad at Rome his military escort (prÃ¦torium), a body of about 10,000 men\\nquartered in the interior of the city. The prÃ¦torians, recruited among the\\nveterans, received high pay and frequent donatives.', 'Relying on these\\nsoldiers, the emperor had nothing to fear from malcontents in Rome. But\\nthe danger came from the prÃ¦torians themselves; as they had the power\\nthey believed they had free rein, and their chief, the prÃ¦torian prefect, was\\nsometimes stronger than the emperor. The Freedmen of the Emperor.', 'â€”Ever since the monarchy had superseded\\nthe republic, there was no other magistrate than the emperor. All the\\nbusiness of the empire of 80,000,000 people originated with him. For this\\ncrushing task he required assistants.', 'He found them, not among the men of\\ngreat family whom he mistrusted, but among the slaves of whom he felt\\nsure. The secretaries, the men of trust, the ministers of the emperor were\\nhis freedmen, the majority of them foreigners from Greece or the Orient,\\npliant people, adepts in flattery, inventiveness, and loquacity. Often the\\nemperor, wearied with serious matters, gave the government into their\\nhands, and, as occurs in absolute monarchies, instead of aiding their\\nmaster, they supplemented him.', \"Pallas and Narcissus, the freedmen of\\nClaudius, distributed offices and pronounced judgments; Helius, Nero's\\nfreedman, had knights and senators executed without even consulting his\\nmaster. Of all the freedmen Pallas was the most powerful, the richest, and\\nthe most insolent; he gave his orders to his underlings only by signs or in\\nwriting. Nothing so outraged the old noble families of Rome as this.\", '\"The\\nprinces,\" said a Roman writer, \"are the masters of citizens and the slaves of\\ntheir freedmen. \" Among the scandals with which the emperors were\\nreproached, one of the gravest was governing Roman citizens by former\\nslaves. Despotism and Disorder.', 'â€”This rÃ©gime had two great vices:\\n1. Despotism. â€”The emperor was invested for life with a power unlimited,\\nextravagant, and hardly conceivable; according to his fancy he disposed of\\npersons and their property, condemned, confiscated, and executed without\\nrestraint.', 'No institution, no law fettered his will. \"The decree of the\\nemperor has the force of law,\" say the jurisconsults themselves. Rome\\nrecognized then the unlimited despotism that the tyrants had exercised in\\nthe Greek cities, no longer circumscribed within the borders of a single city,\\nbut gigantic as the empire itself.', 'As in Greece some honorable tyrants had\\npresented themselves, one sees in Rome some wise and honest monarchs\\n(Augustus, Vespasian, Titus). But few men had a head strong enough to\\nresist vertigo when they saw themselves so elevated above other men. The\\nmajority of the emperors profited by their tremendous power only to make\\ntheir names proverbial: Tiberius, Nero, Domitian by their cruelty, Vitellius\\nby his gluttony, Claudius by his imbecility.', 'One of them, Caligula, was a\\nveritable fool; he had his horse made consul and himself worshipped as a\\ngod. The emperors persecuted the nobles especially to keep them from\\nconspiring against them, and the rich to confiscate their goods. 2.', 'Disorder. â€”This overweening authority was, moreover, very ill\\nregulated; it resided entirely in the person of the emperor. When he was\\ndead, everything was in question.', 'It was well known that the world could\\nnot continue without a master, but no law nor usage determined who was\\nto be this master. The Senate alone had the right of nominating the\\nemperor, but almost always it would elect under pressure the one whom\\nthe preceding emperor had designated or the man who was pleasing to the\\nsoldiers. After the death of Caligula, some prÃ¦torians who were sacking the palace\\ndiscovered, concealed behind the tapestry, a poor man trembling with fear.', 'This was a relative of Caligula; the prÃ¦torians made him emperor (it was\\nthe emperor Claudius). After the death of Nero, the Senate had elected\\nGalba; the prÃ¦torians did not find him liberal enough and so they\\nmassacred him to set up in his place Otho, a favorite of Nero. In their turn\\nthe soldiers on the frontier wished to make an emperor: the legions of the\\nRhine entered Italy, met the prÃ¦torians at Bedriac near Cremona, and\\noverthrew them in so furious a battle that it lasted all night; then they\\ncompelled the Senate to elect Vitellius, their general, as emperor.', 'During\\nthis time the army of Syria had elected its chief Vespasian, who in turn\\ndefeated Vitellius and was named in his place; thus in two years three\\nemperors had been created and three overthrown by the soldiers. The new\\nemperor often undid what his predecessor had done; imperial despotism\\nhad not even the advantage of being stable. The Twelve CÃ¦sars.', 'â€”This regime of oppression interrupted by violence\\nendured for more than a century (31 B. C. to 96 A.', 'D. ). The twelve emperors who came to the throne during this time are called\\nthe Twelve CÃ¦sars, although only the first six were of the family of\\nAugustus.', 'It is difficult to judge them equitably. Almost all of them\\npersecuted the noble families of Rome of whom they were afraid, and it is\\nthe writers of these families that have made their reputation. But it is quite\\npossible that in the provinces their government was mild and just, superior\\nto that of the senators of the republic.', 'THE CENTURY OF THE ANTONINES\\nThe Antonines. â€”The five emperors succeeding the twelve CÃ¦sars, Nerva,\\nTrajan, Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius (96-180), have left a\\nreputation for justice and wisdom. They were called the Antonines, though\\nthis name properly belongs only to the last two.', 'They were not descended\\nfrom the old families of Rome; Trajan and Hadrian were Spaniards,\\nAntoninus was born at NÃ®mes in Gaul. They were not princes of imperial\\nfamily, destined from their birth to rule. Four emperors came to the throne\\nwithout sons and so the empire could not be transmitted by inheritance.', 'On each occasion the prince chose among his generals and his governors\\nthe man most capable of succeeding him; he adopted him as his son and\\nsought his confirmation by the Senate. Thus there came to the empire only\\nexperienced men, who without confusion assumed the throne of their\\nadoptive fathers. Government of the Antonines.', 'â€”This century of the Antonines was the\\ncalmest that the ancient world had ever known. Wars were relegated to the\\nfrontier of the empire. In the interior there were still military seditions,\\ntyranny, and arbitrary condemnations.', 'The Antonines held the army in\\ncheck, organized a council of state of jurisconsults, established tribunals,\\nand replaced the freedmen who had so long irritated the Romans under the\\ntwelve CÃ¦sars by regular functionaries taken from among the men of the\\nsecond classâ€”that is, the knights. The emperor was no longer a tyrant\\nserved by the soldiers; he was truly the first magistrate of the republic,\\nusing his authority only for the good of the citizens. The last two Antonines\\nespecially, Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius, honored the empire by their\\nintegrity.', 'Both lived simply, like ordinary men, although they were very\\nrich, without anything that resembled a court or a palace, never giving the\\nimpression that they were masters. Marcus Aurelius consulted the Senate\\non all state business and regularly attended its sessions. Marcus Aurelius.', 'â€”Marcus Aurelius has been termed the Philosopher on\\nthe Throne. He governed from a sense of duty, against his disposition, for\\nhe loved solitude; and yet he spent his life in administration and the\\ncommand of armies. His private journal (his \"Thoughts\") exhibits the\\ncharacter of the Stoicâ€”virtuous, austere, separated from the world, and yet\\nmild and good.', '\"The best form of vengeance on the wicked is not to imitate\\nthem; the gods themselves do good to evil men; it is your privilege to act\\nlike the gods. \"\\nConquests of the Antonines. â€”The emperors of the first century had\\ncontinued the course of conquest; they had subjected the Britons of\\nEngland, the Germans on the left bank of the Rhine, and in the provinces\\nhad reduced several countries which till then had retained their kingsâ€”\\nMauretania, Thrace, Cappadocia.', 'The Rhine, the Danube, and the\\nEuphrates were the limits of the empire. The emperors of the second century were almost all generals; they had the\\nopportunity of waging numerous wars to repel the hostile peoples who\\nsought to invade the empire. The enemies were in two quarters especially:\\n1.', 'On the Danube were the Dacians, barbarous people, who occupied the\\ncountry of mountains and forests now called Transylvania. 2. On the Euphrates was the great military monarchy of the Parthians\\nwhich had its capital at Ctesiphon, near the ruins of Babylon, and which\\nextended over all Persia.', 'Trajan made several expeditions against the Dacians, crossed the Danube,\\nwon three great battles, and took the capital of the Dacians (101-102). He\\noffered them peace, but when they reopened the war he resolved to end\\nmatters with them: he had a stone bridge built over the Danube, invaded\\nDacia and reduced it to a Roman province (106). Colonies were transferred\\nthither, cities were built, and Dacia became a Roman province where Latin\\nwas spoken and Roman customs were assimilated.', 'When the Roman\\narmies withdrew at the end of the third century, the Latin language\\nremained and continued throughout the Middle Ages, notwithstanding the\\ninvasions of the barbarian Slavs. It is from Transylvania (ancient Dacia)\\nthat the peoples came from the twelfth to the fourteenth century who now\\ninhabit the plains to the north of the Danube. It has preserved the name of\\nRome (Roumania) and speaks a language derived from the Latin, like the\\nFrench or Spanish.', 'Trajan made war on the Parthians also. He crossed the\\nEuphrates, took Ctesiphon, the capital, and advanced into Persia, even to\\nSusa, whence he took away the massive gold throne of the kings of Persia. He constructed a fleet on the Tigris, descended the stream to its mouth and\\nsailed into the Persian Gulf; he would have delighted, like Alexander, in\\nthe conquest of India.', 'He took from the Parthians the country between the\\nEuphrates and the Tigrisâ€”Assyria and Mesopotamiaâ€”and erected there\\ntwo Roman provinces. To commemorate his conquests Trajan erected monuments which still\\nremain. The Column of Trajan on the Roman Forum is a shaft whose basreliefs represent the war against the Dacians.', 'The arch of triumph of\\nBenevento recalls the victories over the Parthians. Of these two conquests one alone was permanent, that of Dacia. The\\nprovinces conquered from the Parthians revolted after the departure of the\\nRoman army.', 'The emperor Hadrian retained Dacia, but returned their\\nprovinces to the Parthians, and the Roman empire again made the\\nEuphrates its eastern frontier. To escape further warfare with the\\nhighlanders of Scotland, Hadrian built a wall in the north of England (the\\nWall of Hadrian) extending across the whole island. There was no need of\\nother wars save against the revolting Jews; these people were overthrown\\nand expelled from Jerusalem, the name of which was changed to obliterate\\nthe memory of the old Jewish kingdom.', 'Marcus Aurelius, the last of the Antonines, had to resist the invasion of\\nseveral barbarous peoples of Germany who had crossed the Danube on the\\nice and had penetrated even to Aquileia, in the north of Italy. In order to\\nenroll a sufficient army he had to enlist slaves and barbarians (172).

IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION\\nExtent of the Empire in the Second Century. â€”The Roman emperors were\\nbut little bent on conquest.', 'But to occupy their army and to secure frontiers\\nwhich might be easily defended, they continued to conquer barbarian\\npeoples for more than a century. When the course of conquest was finally\\narrested after Trajan, the empire extended over all the south of Europe, all\\nthe north of Africa and the west of Asia; it was limited only by natural\\nfrontiersâ€”the ocean to the west; the mountains of Scotland, the Rhine, the\\nDanube, and the Caucasus to the north; the deserts of the Euphrates and of\\nArabia to the east; the cataracts of the Nile and the great desert to the\\nsouth. The empire, therefore, embraced the countries which now constitute\\nEngland, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria,\\nHungary, European Turkey, Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, Egypt, Syria,\\nPalestine, and Asiatic Turkey.', 'It was more than double the extent of the\\nempire of Alexander. This immense territory was subdivided into forty-eight provinces, unequal\\nin size, but the majority of them very large. Thus Gaul from the Pyrenees to\\nthe Rhine formed but seven provinces.', 'The Permanent Army. â€”In the provinces of the interior there was no\\nRoman army, for the peoples of the empire had no desire to revolt. It was\\non the frontier that the empire had its enemies, foreigners always ready to\\ninvade: behind the Rhine and the Danube the barbarian Germans; behind\\nthe sands of Africa the nomads of the desert; behind the Euphrates the\\nPersian army.', 'On this frontier which was constantly threatened it was\\nnecessary to have soldiers always in readiness.

There were, then, thirty\\nlegions of citizensâ€”that is, 180,000 legionaries, and, according to Roman\\nusage, a slightly larger number of auxiliariesâ€”in all about 400,000 men. This number was small for so large a territory.', 'Each frontier province had its little army, garrisoned in a permanent camp\\nsimilar to a fortress. Merchants came to establish themselves in the vicinity,\\nand the camp was transformed into a city; but still the soldiers, encamped\\nin the face of the enemy, preserved their valor and their discipline. There\\nwere for three centuries severe wars, especially on the banks of the Rhine\\nand of the Danube, where Romans fought fierce barbarians in a swampy\\ncountry, uncultivated, covered with forests and bogs.', 'The imperial army\\nexhibited, perhaps, as much bravery and energy in these obscure wars as\\nthe ancient Romans in the conquest of the world.

But as\\nthe emperor could not be everywhere at once, he sent deputies appointed\\nby himself. To each province went a lieutenant (called a deputy of\\nAugustus with the function of prÃ¦tor); this official governed the country,\\ncommanded the army, and went on circuit through his province to judge\\nimportant cases, for he, like the emperor, had the right of life and death.', 'The emperor sent also a financial agent to levy the taxes and return the\\nmoney to the imperial chest. This official was called the \"procurator of\\nAugustus. \" These two men represented the emperor, governing his\\nsubjects, commanding his soldiers, and exploiting his domain.', 'The\\nemperor always chose them among the two nobilities of Rome, the prÃ¦tors\\nfrom the senators, the procurators from the knights. For them, as for the\\nmagistrates of old Rome, there was a succession of offices: they passed\\nfrom one province to another, from one end of the empire to the other,\\nfrom Syria to Spain, from Britain to Africa.

The emperor had the right of interfering in their local affairs, but ordinarily\\nhe did not exercise this right.', 'He only demanded of them that they keep\\nthe peace, pay their taxes regularly, and appear before the tribunal of the\\ngovernor. There were in every province several of these little subordinate\\ngovernments; they were called, just as at other times the Roman state was\\ncalled, \"cities,\" and sometimes municipalities. A city in the empire was\\ncopied after the Roman city: it also had its assembly of the people, its\\nmagistrates elected for a year and grouped into colleges of two members,\\nits senate called a curia, formed of the great proprietors, people rich and of\\nold family.', 'There, as at Rome, the assembly of the people was hardly more\\nthan a form; it is the senateâ€”that is to say, the nobility, that governs. The centre of the provincial city was always a town, a Rome in miniature,\\nwith its temples, its triumphal arches, its public baths, its fountains, its\\ntheatres, and its arenas for the combats. The life led there was that of Rome\\non a small scale: distributions of grain and money, public banquets, grand\\nreligious ceremonies, and bloody spectacles.', 'Only, in Rome, it was the\\nmoney of the provinces that paid the expenses; in the municipalities the\\nnobility itself defrayed the costs of government and fÃªtes. The tax levied for\\nthe treasury of the emperor went entirely to the imperial chest; it was\\nnecessary, then, that the rich of the city should at their own charges\\ncelebrate the games, heat the baths, pave the streets, construct the bridges,\\naqueducts, and circuses. They did this for more than two centuries, and did\\nit generously; monuments scattered over the whole of the empire and\\nthousands of inscriptions are a witness to this.', 'The Imperial RÃ©gime. â€”After the conquest three or four hundred families\\nof the nobility of Rome governed and exploited the rest of the world. The\\nemperor deprived them of the government and subjected them to his\\ntyranny.', 'The Roman writers could groan over their lost liberty. The\\ninhabitants of the provinces had nothing to regret; they remained subject,\\nbut in place of several hundreds of masters, ceaselessly renewed and\\ndetermined to enrich themselves, they had now a single sovereign, the\\nemperor, interested to spare them. Tiberius stated the imperial policy in the\\nfollowing words: \"A good shepherd shears his sheep, but does not flay\\nthem.', '\" For more than two centuries the emperors contented themselves\\nwith shearing the people of the empire; they took much of their money, but\\nthey protected them from the enemy without, and even against their own\\nagents. When the provincials had grounds of complaint on account of the\\nviolence or the robbery of their governor, they could appeal to the emperor\\nand secure justice. It was known that the emperor received complaints\\nagainst his subordinates; this was sufficient to frighten bad governors and\\nreassure subjects.', 'Some emperors, like Marcus Aurelius, came to recognize\\nthat they had duties to their subjects. The other emperors at least left their\\nsubjects to govern themselves when they had no interest to prevent this. The imperial rÃ©gime was a loss for the Romans, but a deliverance for their\\nsubjects: it abased the conquerors and raised the vanquished, reconciling\\nthem and preparing them for assimilation in the empire.', 'SOCIAL LIFE UNDER THE EMPIRE\\nMoral Decay Continues at Rome. â€”Seneca in his Letters and Juvenal in his\\nSatires have presented portraits of the men and women of their time so\\nstriking that the corruption of the Rome of the CÃ¦sars has remained\\nproverbial. They were not only the disorders left over from the republicâ€”\\nthe gross extravagance of the rich, the ferocity of masters against their\\nslaves, the unbridled frivolity of women.', 'The evil did not arise with the\\nimperial rÃ©gime, but resulted from the excessive accumulation of the riches\\nof the world in the hands of some thousands of nobles or upstarts, under\\nwhom lived some hundreds of free men in poverty, and slaves by millions\\nsubjected to an unrestrained oppression. Each of these great proprietors\\nlived in the midst of his slaves like a petty prince, indolent and capricious. His house at Rome was like a palace; every morning the hall of honor (the\\natrium) was filled with clients, citizens who came for a meagre salary to\\nsalute the master and escort him in the street.', 'For fashion required that a\\nrich man should never appear in public unless surrounded by a crowd;\\nHorace ridicules a prÃ¦tor who traversed the streets of Tibur with only five\\nslaves in his following. Outside Rome the great possessed magnificent\\nvillas at the sea-shore or in the mountains; they went from one to the other,\\nidle and bored. These great families were rapidly extinguished.', 'Alarmed at the\\ndiminishing number of free men, Augustus had made laws to encourage\\nmarriage and to punish celibacy. As one might expect, his laws did not\\nremedy the evil. There were so many rich men who had not married that it\\nhad become a lucrative trade to flatter them in order to be mentioned in\\ntheir will; by having no children one could surround himself with a crowd\\nof flatterers.', '\"In the city,\" says a Roman story-teller, \"all men divide\\nthemselves into two classes, those who fish, and those who are angled for. \"\\n\"Losing his children augments the influence of a man. \"\\nThe Shows.', 'â€”In the life of this idle people of Rome the spectacles held a\\nplace that we are now hardly able to conceive. They were, as in Greece,\\ngames, that is to say, religious ceremonies. The games proceeded\\nthroughout the day and again on the following day, and this for a week at\\nleast.', 'The amphitheatre was, as it were, the rendezvous of the whole free\\npopulation; it was there that they manifested themselves. Thus in 196,\\nduring the civil wars, all the spectators cried with one voice, \"Peace!\" The\\nspectacle was the passion of the time. Three emperors appeared in public,\\nCaligula as a driver, Nero as an actor, Commodus as a gladiator.', 'The Theatre. â€”There were three sorts of spectacles: the theatre, the circus,\\nand the amphitheatre. The theatre was organized on Greek models.', 'The actors were masked and\\npresented plays imitated from the Greek. The Romans had little taste for\\nthis recreation which was too delicate for them. They preferred the mimes,\\ncomedies of gross character, and especially the pantomimes in which the\\nactor without speaking expressed by his attitudes the sentiments of the\\ncharacter.', 'The Circus. â€”Between the two hills of the Aventine and the Palatine\\nextended a field filled with race courses surrounded by arcades and tiers of\\nseats rising above them. This was the Circus Maximus.', 'After Nero enlarged\\nit it could accommodate 250,000 spectators; in the fourth century its size\\nwas increased to provide sittings for 385,000 people. Here was presented the favorite spectacle of the Roman people, the fourhorse chariot race (quadrigÃ¦); in each race the chariot made a triple circuit\\nof the circus and there were twenty-five races in a single day. The drivers\\nbelonged to rival companies whose colors they wore; there were at first\\nfour of these colors, but they were later reduced to twoâ€”the Blue and the\\nGreen, notorious in the history of riots.', 'At Rome there was the same\\npassion for chariot-races that there is now for horse-races; women and even\\nchildren talked of them. Often the emperor participated and the quarrel\\nbetween the Blues and the Greens became an affair of state. The Amphitheatre.', 'â€”At the gates of Rome the emperor Vespasian had built\\nthe Colosseum, an enormous structure of two stories, accommodating\\n87,000 spectators. It was a circus surrounding an arena where hunts and\\ncombats were represented. For the hunts the arena was transformed into a forest where wild beasts\\nwere released and men armed with spears came into combat with them.', 'Variety was sought in this spectacle by employing the rarest animalsâ€”\\nlions, panthers, elephants, bears, buffaloes, rhinoceroses, giraffes, tigers,\\nand crocodiles. In the games presented by Pompey had already appeared\\nseventeen elephants and five hundred lions; some of the emperors\\nmaintained a large menagerie. Sometimes instead of placing armed men before the beasts, it was found\\nmore dramatic to let loose the animals on men who were naked and bound.', 'The custom spread into all cities of the empire of compelling those\\ncondemned to death to furnish this form of entertainment for the people. Thousands of persons of both sexes and of every age, and among them\\nChristian martyrs, were thus devoured by beasts under the eyes of the\\nmultitude. The Gladiators.', 'â€”But the national spectacle of the Romans was the fight of\\ngladiators (men armed with swords). Armed men descended into the arena\\nand fought a duel to the death. From the time of CÃ¦sar as many as 320\\npairs of gladiators were fought at once; Augustus in his whole life fought\\n10,000 of them, Trajan the same number in four months.', 'The vanquished\\nwas slain on the field unless the people wished to show him grace. Sometimes the condemned were compelled to fight, but more often slaves\\nand prisoners of war. Each victory thus brought to the amphitheatre bands\\nof barbarians who exterminated one another for the delight of the\\nspectators.', 'Gladiators were furnished by all countriesâ€”Gauls, Germans,\\nThracians, and sometimes negroes. These peoples fought with various\\nweapons, usually with their national arms. The Romans loved to behold\\nthese battles in miniature.', 'There were also, among these contestants in the circus, some who fought\\nfrom their own choice, free men who from a taste for danger submitted to\\nthe terrible discipline of the gladiator, and swore to their chief \"to allow\\nthemselves to be beaten with rods, be burned with hot iron, and even be\\nkilled. \" Many senators enrolled themselves in these bands of slaves and\\nadventurers, and even an emperor, Commodus, descended into the arena. These bloody games were practised not only at Rome, but in all the cities of\\nItaly, Gaul, and Africa.', 'The Greeks always opposed their adoption. An\\ninscription on a statue raised to one of the notables in the little city of\\nMinturnÃ¦ runs as follows: \"He presented in four days eleven pairs of\\ngladiators who ceased to fight only when half of them had fallen in the\\narena. He gave a hunt of ten terrible bears.', 'Treasure this in memory, noble\\nfellow-citizens. \" The people, therefore, had the passion for blood, which\\nstill manifests itself in Spain in bull-fights. The emperor, like the modern\\nking of Spain, must be present at these butcheries.', 'Marcus Aurelius became\\nunpopular in Rome because he exhibited his weariness at the spectacles of\\nthe amphitheatre by reading, speaking, or giving audiences instead of\\nregarding the games. When he enlisted gladiators to serve against the\\nbarbarians who invaded Italy, the populace was about to revolt. \"He would\\ndeprive us of our amusements,\" cried one, \"to compel us to become\\nphilosophers.', '\"\\nThe Roman Peace. â€”But there was in the empire something else than the\\npopulace of Rome. To be just to the empire as a whole one must consider\\nevents in the provinces.', 'By subjecting all peoples, the Romans had\\nsuppressed war in the interior of their empire. Thus was established the\\nRoman Peace which a Greek author describes in the following language:\\n\"Every man can go where he will; the harbors are full of ships, the\\nmountains are safe for travellers just as the towns for their inhabitants. Fear\\nhas everywhere ceased.', 'The land has put off its old armor of iron and put\\non festal garments. You have realized the word of Homer, \\'the earth is\\ncommon to all. \\'\" For the first time, indeed, men of the Occident could build\\ntheir houses, cultivate their fields, enjoy their property and their leisure\\nwithout fearing at every moment being robbed, massacred, or thrown into\\nslaveryâ€”a security which we can hardly appreciate since we have enjoyed\\nit from infancy, but which seemed very sweet to the men of antiquity.', 'The Fusion of Peoples. â€”In this empire now at peace travel became easy. The Romans had built roads in every direction with stations and relays;\\nthey had also made road-maps of the empire.', 'Many people, artisans,\\ntraders, journeyed from one end of the empire to the other. Rhetors and\\nphilosophers penetrated all Europe, going from one city to another giving\\nlectures. In every province could be found men from the most remote\\nprovinces.', 'Inscriptions show us in Spain professors, painters, Greek\\nsculptors; in Gaul, goldsmiths and Asiatic workmen. Everybody\\ntransported and mingled customs, arts, and religion. Little by little they\\naccustomed themselves to speak the language of the Romans.', 'From the\\nthird century the Latin had become the common language of the West, as\\nthe Greek since the successors of Alexander had been the language of the\\nOrient. Thus, as in Alexandria, a common civilization was developed. This\\nhas been called by the name Roman, though it was this hardly more than in\\nname and in language.', \"In reality, it was the civilization of the ancient world\\nunited under the emperor's authority. Superstitions. â€”Religious beliefs were everywhere blended.\", 'As the ancients\\ndid not believe in a single God, it was easy for them to adopt new gods. All\\npeoples, each of whom had its own religion, far from rejecting the religions\\nof others, adopted the gods of their neighbors and fused them with their\\nown. The Romans set the example by raising the Pantheon, a temple to \"all\\nthe gods,\" where each deity had his sanctuary.', 'Everywhere there was much credulity. Men believed in the divinity of the\\ndead emperors; it was believed that Vespasian had in Egypt healed a blind\\nman and a paralytic. During the war with the Dacians the Roman army\\nwas perishing of thirst; all at once it began to rain, and the sudden storm\\nappeared to all as a miracle; some said that an Egyptian magician had\\nconjured Hermes, others believed that Jupiter had taken pity on the\\nsoldiers; and on the column of Marcus Aurelius Jupiter was represented,\\nthunderbolt in hand, sending the rain which the soldiers caught in their\\nbucklers.', 'When the apostles Barnabas and Paul came to the city of Lystra in Asia\\nMinor, the inhabitants invoked Barnabas as Jupiter and Paul as Mercury;\\nthey were met by a procession, with priests at the head leading a bull\\nwhich they were about to sacrifice. Cultured people were none the less credulous. The Stoic philosophers\\nadmitted omens.', 'The emperor Augustus regarded it as a bad sign when he\\nput on the wrong shoe. Suetonius wrote to Pliny the Younger, begging him\\nto transfer his case to another day on account of a dream which he had had. Pliny the Younger believed in ghosts.', 'Among peoples ready to admit everything, different religions, instead of\\ngoing to pieces, fused into a common religion. This religion, at once Greek,\\nRoman, Egyptian, and Asiatic, dominated the world at the second century\\nof our era; and so the Christians called it the religion of the nations; down\\nto the fourth century they gave the pagans the name of \"gentiles\" (men of\\nthe nations); at the same time the common law was called the Law of\\nNations. CHAPTER XXV\\nTHE ARTS AND SCIENCES IN ROME\\nLETTERS\\nImitation of the Greeks.', 'â€”The Romans were not artists naturally. They\\nbecame so very late and by imitating the Greeks. From Greece they took\\ntheir models of tragedy, comedy, the epic, the ode, the didactic poem,\\npastoral poetry, and history.', 'Some writers limited themselves to the free\\ntranslation of a Greek original (as Horace in his Odes). All borrowed from\\nthe Greeks at least their ideas and their forms. But they carried into this\\nwork of adaptation their qualities of patience and vigor, and many came to\\na true originality.', 'The Age of Augustus. â€”There is common agreement in regarding the fifty\\nyears of the government of Augustus as the most brilliant period in Latin\\nliterature. It is the time of Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Tibullus, Propertius, and\\nLivy.', 'The emperor, or rather his friend MÃ¦cenas, personally patronized\\nsome of these poets, especially Horace and Vergil, who sang the glory of\\nAugustus and of his time. But this Augustan Age was preceded and\\nfollowed by two centuries that perhaps equalled it. It was in the preceding\\ncentury, the first before Christ, that the most original Romanpoet appeared,\\nCÃ¦sar the most elegant prose-writer, and Cicero the greatest orator.', 'It was\\nin the following age that Seneca, Lucan, Tacitus, Pliny, and Juvenal wrote. Between Lucretius and Tacitus there were for three centuries many great\\nwriters in Rome. One might also add another century by recurring to the\\ntime of Plautus, the second century before Christ.', 'Of these great authors a few had their origin in Roman families; but the\\nmajority of them were Italians. Many came from the provinces, Vergil from\\nMantua, Livy from Padua (in Cisalpine Gaul), while Seneca was a\\nSpaniard. Orators and Rhetors.', 'â€”The true national art at Rome was eloquence. Like\\nthe Italians of our day, the Romans loved to speak in public. In the forum\\nwhere they held the assemblies of the people was the rostrum, the platform\\nfor addressing the people, so named from the prows of captured ships that\\nornamented it like trophies of war.', 'Thither the orators came in the last\\nepoch of the republic to declaim and to gesticulate before a tumultuous\\ncrowd. The tribunals, often composed of a hundred judges, furnished another\\noccasion for eloquent advocates. The Roman law permitted the accused to\\nhave an advocate speak in his place.', 'There were orators in Rome from the second century. Here, as in Athens,\\nthe older orators, such as Cato and the Gracchi, spoke simply, too simply\\nfor the taste of Cicero. Those who followed them in the first century\\nlearned in the schools of the Greek rhetors the long oratorical periods and\\npompous style.', 'The greatest of all was Cicero, the only one whose works\\nhave come down to us in anything but fragments; and yet we have his\\nspeeches as they were left by him and not as they were delivered. With the fall of the republic the assemblies and the great political trials\\nceased. Eloquence perished for the want of matter, and the Roman writers\\nremarked this with bitterness.', 'Then the rhetors commenced to multiply,\\nwho taught the art of speaking well. Some of these teachers had their\\npupils compose as exercises pleas on imaginary rhetorical subjects. The\\nrhetor Seneca has left us many of these oratorical themes; they discuss\\nstolen children, brigands, and romantic adventures.', 'Then came the mania for public lectures. Pollio, a favorite of Augustus, had\\nset the example. For a century it was the fashion to read poems, panegyrics,\\neven tragedies before an audience of friends assembled to applaud them.', 'The taste for eloquence that had once produced great orators exhibited in\\nthe later centuries only finished declaimers. Importance of the Latin Literature and Language. â€”Latin literature profited\\nby the conquests of Rome; the Romans carried it with their language to\\ntheir barbarian subjects of the West.', 'All the peoples of Italy, Gaul, Spain,\\nAfrica, and the Danubian lands discarded their language and took the\\nLatin. Having no national literature, they adopted that of their masters. The\\nempire was thus divided between the two languages of the two great\\npeoples of antiquity: the Orient continued to speak Greek; almost the entire\\nOccident acquired the Latin.', 'Latin was not only the official language of the\\nstate functionaries and of great men, like the English of our day in India;\\nthe people themselves spoke it with greater or less correctnessâ€”in fact, so\\nwell that today eighteen centuries after the conquest five languages of\\nEurope are derived from the Latinâ€”the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,\\nFrench, and Roumanian. With the Latin language the Latin literature extended itself over all the\\nWest. In the schools of Bordeaux and Autun in the fifth century only Latin\\npoets and orators were studied.', 'After the coming of the barbarians, bishops\\nand monks continued to write in Latin and they carried this practice\\namong the peoples of England and Germany who were still speaking their\\nnative languages. Throughout almost the whole mediÃ¦val period, acts,\\nlaws, histories, and books of science were written in Latin. In the convents\\nand the schools they read, copied, and appreciated only works written in\\nLatin; beside books of piety only the Latin authors were knownâ€”Vergil,\\nHorace, Cicero, and Pliny the Younger.', 'The renaissance of the fifteenth and\\nsixteenth centuries consisted partly in reviving the forgotten Latin writers. More than ever it was the fashion to know and to imitate them. As the Romans constructed a literature in imitation of the Greeks, the\\nmoderns have taken the Latin writers for their models.', 'Was this good or\\nbad? Who would venture to say? But the fact is indisputable. Our romance\\nlanguages are daughters of the Latin, our literatures are full of the ideas\\nand of the literary methods of the Romans. The whole western world is\\nimpregnated with the Latin literature.', 'THE ARTS\\nSculpture and Painting. â€”Great numbers of Roman statues and bas-reliefs\\nof the time of the empire have come to light. Some are reproductions and\\nalmost all are imitations of Greek works, but less elegant and less delicate\\nthan the models.', 'The most original productions of this form of art are the\\nbas-reliefs and the busts. Bas-reliefs adorned the monuments (temples, columns, and triumphal\\narches), tombs, and sarcophagi. They represent with scrupulous fidelity\\nreal scenes, such as processions, sacrifices, combats, and funeral\\nceremonies and so give us information about ancient life.', 'The bas-reliefs\\nwhich surround the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius bring us into\\nthe presence of the great scenes of their wars. One may see the soldiers\\nfighting against the barbarians, besieging their fortresses, leading away the\\ncaptives; the solemn sacrifices, and the emperor haranguing the troops. The busts are especially those of the emperors, of their wives and their\\nchildren.', 'As they were scattered in profusion throughout the empire, so\\nmany have been found that today all the great museums of Europe have\\ncollections of imperial busts. They are real portraits, probably very close\\nresemblances, for each emperor had a well-marked physiognomy, often of\\na striking ugliness that no one attempted to disguise. In general, Roman sculpture holds itself much more close to reality than\\ndoes the Greek; it may be said that the artist is less concerned with\\nrepresenting things beautifully than exactly.', 'Of Roman painting we know only the frescoes painted on the walls of the\\nrich houses of Pompeii and of the house of Livy at Rome. We do not know\\nbut these were the work of Greek painters; they bear a close resemblance to\\nthe paintings on Greek vases, having the same simple and elegant grace. Architecture.', 'â€”The true Roman art, because it operated to satisfy a\\npractical need, is architecture. In this too the Romans imitated the Greeks,\\nborrowing the column from them. But they had a form that the Greeks\\nnever employedâ€”the arch, that is to say, the art of arranging cut stones in\\nthe arc of a circle so that they supported one another.', 'The arch allowed\\nthem to erect buildings much larger and more varied than those of the\\nGreeks. The following are the principal varieties of Roman monuments:\\n1. The Temple was sometimes similar to a Greek temple with a broad\\nvestibule, sometimes vaster and surmounted with a dome.', 'Of this sort is\\nthe Pantheon built in Rome under Augustus. 2. The Basilica was a long low edifice, covered with a roof and surrounded\\nwith porticos.', 'There sat the judge with his assistants about him; traders\\ndiscussed the price of goods; the place was at once a bourse and a tribunal. It was in the basilicas that the assemblies of the Christians were later held,\\nand for several centuries the Christian churches preserved the name and\\nform of basilicas. 3.', 'The Amphitheatre and the Circus were constructed of several stories of\\narcades surrounding an arena; each range of arcades supported many rows\\nof seats. Such were the Colosseum at Rome and the arenas at Arles and\\nNÃ®mes. 4.', 'The Arch of Triumph was a gate of honor wide enough for the passage\\nof a chariot, adorned with columns and surmounted with a group of\\nsculpture. The Arch of Titus is an example. 5.', 'The Sepulchral Vault was an arched edifice provided with many rows of\\nniches, in each of which were laid the ashes of a corpse. It was called a\\nColumbarium (pigeon-house) from its shape. 6.', 'The ThermÃ¦ were composed of bathing-halls furnished with basins. The\\nheat was provided by a furnace placed in an underground chamber. The\\nThermÃ¦ in a Roman city were what the gymnasium was in a Greek cityâ€”a\\nrendezvous for the idle.', 'Much more than the gymnasium it was a labyrinth\\nof halls of every sort: there were a cool hall, warm apartments, a robingroom, a hall where the body was anointed with oil, parlors, halls for\\nexercise, gardens, and the whole surrounded by an enormous wall. Thus\\nthe ThermÃ¦ of Caracalla covered an immense area. 7.', 'The Bridge and the Aqueduct were supported by a range of arches\\nthrown over a river or over a valley. Examples are the bridge of Alcantara\\nand the Pont du Gard. 8.', 'The House of a rich Roman was a work of art. Unlike our modern\\nhouses, the ancient house had no faÃ§ade; the house was turned entirely\\ntoward the interior; on the outside it showed only bare walls. The rooms were small, ill furnished, and dark; they were lighted only\\nthrough the atrium.', 'In the centre was the great hall of honor (the atrium)\\nwhere the statues of the ancestors were erected and where visitors were\\nreceived. It was illuminated by an opening in the roof. Behind the atrium was the peristyle, a garden surrounded by colonnades,\\nin which were the dining halls, richly ornamented and provided with\\ncouches, for among the rich Romans, as among the Asiatic Greeks, guests\\nreclined on couches at the banquets.', 'The pavement was often made of\\nmosaic. Character of the Roman Architecture. â€”The Romans, unlike the Greeks, did\\nnot always build in marble.', 'Ordinarily they used the stone that they found\\nin the country, binding this together with an indestructible mortar which\\nhas resisted even dampness for eighteen hundred years. Their monuments\\nhave not the wonderful grace of the Greek monuments, but they are large,\\nstrong, and solidâ€”like the Roman power. The soil of the empire is still\\ncovered with their dÃ©bris.', 'We are astonished to find monuments almost\\nintact as remote as the deserts of Africa. When it was planned to furnish a\\nwater-system for the city of Tunis, all that had to be done was to repair a\\nRoman aqueduct. Rome and Its Monuments.', 'â€”Rome at the time of the emperors was a city of\\n2,000,000 inhabitants. This population was herded in houses of five and six\\nstories, poorly built and crowded together. The populous quarters were a\\nlabyrinth of tortuous paths, steep, and ill paved.', 'Juvenal who frequented\\nthem leaves us a picture of them which has little attractiveness. At Pompeii,\\na city of luxury, it may be seen how narrow were the streets of a Roman\\ncity. In the midst of hovels monuments by the hundred would be erected.', 'The emperor Augustus boasted of having restored more than eighty\\ntemples. \"I found a city of bricks,\" said he; \"I leave a city of marble. \" His\\nsuccessors all worked to embellish Rome.', 'It was especially about the\\nForum that the monuments accumulated. The Capitol with its temple of\\nJupiter became almost like the Acropolis at Athens. In the same quarter\\nmany monumental areas were constructedâ€”the forum of CÃ¦sar, the forum\\nof Augustus, the forum of Nerva, and, most brilliant of all, the forum of\\nTrajan.', 'Two villas surrounded by a park were situated in the midst of the\\ncity; the most noted was the Golden House, built for Nero. THE LAW\\nThe Twelve Tables. â€”The Romans, like all other ancient peoples, had at\\nfirst no written laws.', 'They followed the customs of the ancestorsâ€”that is to\\nsay, each generation did in everything just as the preceding generation did. In 450 ten specially elected magistrates, the decemvirs, made a series of\\nlaws that they wrote on twelve tables of stone. This was the Law of the\\nTwelve Tables, codified in short, rude, and trenchant sentencesâ€”a\\nlegislation severe and rude like the semi-barbarous people for whom it was\\nmade.', 'It punished the sorcerer who by magical words blasted the crop of\\nhis neighbor. It pronounced against the insolvent debtor, \"If he does not\\npay, he shall be cited before the court; if sickness or age deter him, a horse\\nshall be furnished him, but no litter; he may have thirty days\\' delay, but if\\nhe does not satisfy the debt in this time, the creditor may bind him with\\nstraps or chains of fifteen pounds weight; at the end of sixty days he may\\nbe sold beyond the Tiber; if there are many creditors, they may cut him in\\nparts, and if they cut more or less, there is no wrong in the act. \" According\\nto the word of Cicero, the Law of the Twelve Tables was \"the source of all\\nthe Roman law.', '\" Four centuries after it was written down the children had\\nto learn it in the schools. The Symbolic Process. â€”In the ancient Roman law it was not enough in\\nbuying, selling, or inheriting that this was the intention of the actor; to\\nobtain justice in the Roman tribunal it was not sufficient to present the case;\\none had to pronounce certain words and use certain gestures.', 'Consider, for\\nexample, the manner of purchasing. In the presence of five citizens who\\nrepresent an assembly and of a sixth who holds a balance in his hand, the\\nbuyer places in the balance a piece of brass which represents the price of\\nthe thing sold. If it be an animal or a slave that is sold, the purchaser\\ntouches it with his hand saying, \"This is mine by the law of the Romans, I\\nhave bought it with this brass duly weighed.', '\" Before the tribunal every\\nprocess is a pantomime: to reclaim an object one seizes it with the hand; to\\nprotest against a neighbor who has erected a wall, a stone is thrown against\\nthe wall. When two men claim proprietorship in a field, the following takes\\nplace at the tribunal: the two adversaries grasp hands and appear to fight;\\nthen they separate and each says, \"I declare this field is mine by the law of\\nthe Romans; I cite you before the tribunal of the prÃ¦tor to debate our right\\nat the place in question. \" The judge orders them to go to the place.', '\"Before\\nthese witnesses here present, this is your road to the place; go!\" The\\nlitigants take a few steps as if to go thither, and this is the symbol of the\\njourney. A witness says to them, \"Return,\" and the journey is regarded as\\ncompleted. Each of the two presents a clod of earth, the symbol of the field.', 'Thus the trial commences; then the judge alone hears the case. Like all\\nprimitive peoples, the Romans comprehended well only what they actually\\nsaw; the material acts served to represent to them the right that could not\\nbe seen. The Formalism of Roman Law.', 'â€”The Romans scrupulously respected their\\nancient forms. In justice, as in religion, they obeyed the letter of the law,\\ncaring nothing for its sense. For them every form was sacred and ought to\\nbe strictly applied.', 'In cases before the courts their maxim was: \"What has\\nalready been pronounced ought to be the law. \" If an advocate made a\\nmistake in one word in reciting the formula, his case was lost. A man\\nentered a case against his neighbor for having cut down his vines: the\\nformula that he ought to use contained the word \"arbor,\" he replaced it\\nwith the word \"vinea,\" and could not win his case.', 'This absolute reverence for the form allowed the Romans some strange\\naccommodations. The law said that if a father sold his son three times, the\\nson should be freed from the power of the father; when, therefore, a Roman\\nwished to emancipate his son, he sold him three times in succession, and\\nthis comedy of sale sufficed to emancipate him. The law required that before beginning war a herald should be sent to\\ndeclare it at the frontier of the enemy.', 'When Rome wished to make war on\\nPyrrhus, king of Epirus, who had his kingdom on the other side of the\\nAdriatic, they were much embarrassed to execute this formality. They hit\\non the following: a subject of Pyrrhus, perhaps a deserter, bought a field in\\nRome; they then assumed that this territory had become territory of Epirus,\\nand the herald threw his javelin on this land and made his solemn\\ndeclaration. Like all other immature peoples, the Romans believed that\\nconsecrated formulas had a magical virtue.', 'Jurisprudence. â€”The Law of the Twelve Tables and the laws made after\\nthem were brief and incomplete. But many questions presented themselves\\nthat had no law for their solution.', 'In these embarrassing cases it was the\\ncustom at Rome to consult certain persons who were of high reputation for\\ntheir knowledge of questions of law. These were men of eminence, often\\nold consuls or pontiffs; they gave their advice in writing, and their replies\\nwere called the Responses of the Wise. Usually these responses were\\nauthoritative according to the respect had for the sages.', 'The emperor\\nAugustus went further: he named some of them whose responses should\\nhave the force of law. Thus Law began to be a science and the men versed\\nin law formulated new rules which became obligatory. This was\\nJurisprudence.', 'The PrÃ¦tor\\'s Edict. â€”To apply the sacred rules of law a supreme magistrate\\nwas needed at Rome. Only a consul or a prÃ¦tor could direct a tribunal and,\\naccording to the Roman expression, \"say the law.', '\" The consuls engaged\\nespecially with the army ordinarily left this care to the prÃ¦tors. There were always at Rome at least two prÃ¦tors as judges: one adjudicated\\nmatters between citizens and was called the prÃ¦tor of the city (prÃ¦tor\\nurbanus); the other judged cases between citizens and aliens and was\\ncalled prÃ¦tor of the aliens (prÃ¦tor peregrinus), or, more exactly, prÃ¦tor\\nbetween aliens and citizens. There was need of at least two tribunals, since\\nan alien could not be admitted to the tribunal of the citizens.', \"These prÃ¦tors,\\nthanks to their absolute power, adjusted cases according to their sense of\\nequity; the prÃ¦tor of the aliens was bound by no law, for the Roman laws\\nwere made only for Roman citizens. And yet, since each prÃ¦tor was to sit\\nand judge for a year, on entering upon his office he promulgated a decree\\nin which he indicated the rules that he expected to follow in his tribunal;\\nthis was the PrÃ¦tor's Edict. At the end of the year, when the prÃ¦ter left his\\noffice, his ordinance was no longer in force, and his successor had the right\\nto make an entirely different one.\", 'But it came to be the custom for each\\nprÃ¦tor to preserve the edicts of his predecessors, making a few changes\\nand some additions. Thus accumulated for centuries the ordinances of the\\nmagistrates. At last the emperor Hadrian in the second century had the\\nPrÃ¦torian Edict codified and gave it the force of law.', 'Civil Law and the Law of Nations. â€”As there were two separate tribunals,\\nthere developed two systems of rules, two different laws. The rules applied\\nto the affairs of citizens by the prÃ¦tor of the city formed the Civil Lawâ€”\\nthat is to say, the law of the city.', 'The rules followed by the prÃ¦tor of aliens\\nconstituted the Law of Nationsâ€”that is to say, of the peoples (alien to\\nRome). It was then perceived that of these two laws the more human, the\\nmore sensible, the simplerâ€”in a word, the better, was the law of aliens. The\\nlaw of citizens, derived from the superstitious and strict rules of the old\\nRomans, had preserved from this rude origin troublesome formulas and\\nbarbarous regulations.', 'The Law of Nations, on the contrary, had for its\\nfoundation the dealings of merchants and of men established in Rome,\\ndealings that were free from every formula, from every national prejudice,\\nand were slowly developed and tried by the experience of several\\ncenturies. And so it may be seen how contrary to reason the ancient law\\nwas. \"Strict law is the highest injustice,\" is a Roman proverb.', 'The prÃ¦tors of\\nthe city set themselves to correct the ancient law and to judge according to\\nequity or justice. They came gradually to apply to citizens the same rules\\nthat the prÃ¦tor of the aliens followed in his tribunal. For example, the\\nRoman law ordained that only relatives on the male side should be heirs;\\nthe prÃ¦tor summoned the relatives on the female side also to participate in\\nthe succession.', 'The old law required that a man to become a proprietor must perform a\\ncomplicated ceremony of sale; the prÃ¦tor recognized that it was sufficient\\nto have paid the price of the sale and to be in possession of the property. Thus the Law of Nations invaded and gradually superseded the Civil Law. \"Written Reason.', '\"â€”It was especially under the emperors that the new\\nRoman law took its form. The Antonines issued many ordinances (edicts)\\nand re-scripts (letters in which the emperor replied to those who consulted\\nhim). Jurisconsults who surrounded them assisted them in their reforms.', 'Later, at the beginning of the third century, under the bad emperors as\\nunder the good, others continued to state new rules and to rectify the old. Papinian, Ulpian, Modestinus, and Paullus were the most noted of these\\nlawyers; their works definitively fixed the Roman law. This law of the third century has little resemblance to the old Roman law,\\nso severe on the weak.', 'The jurisconsults adopt the ideas of the Greek\\nphilosophers, especially of the Stoics. They consider that all men have the\\nright of liberty: \"By the law of nature all men are born free,\" which is to say\\nthat slavery is contrary to nature. They also admit that a slave could claim\\nredress even against his master, and that the master, if he killed his slave,\\nshould be punished as a murderer.', 'Likewise they protect the child against\\nthe tyranny of the father. It is this new law that was in later times called Written Reason. In fact, it is\\na philosophical law such as reason can conceive for all men.', 'And so there\\nremains no longer an atom of the strict and gross law of the Twelve Tables. The Roman law which has for a long time governed all Europe, and which\\ntoday is preserved in part in the laws of several European states is not the\\nlaw of the old Romans. It is constructed, on the contrary, of the customs of\\nall the peoples of antiquity and the maxims of Greek philosophers fused\\ntogether and codified in the course of centuries by Roman magistrates and\\njurisconsults.', 'CHAPTER XXVI\\nTHE CHRISTIAN RELIGION\\nORIGIN OF CHRISTIANITY\\nThe Christ. â€”He whom the Jews were expecting as their liberator and king,\\nthe Messiah, appeared in Galilee, a small province of the North, hardly\\nregarded as Jewish, and in a humble family of carpenters. He was called\\nJesus, but his Greek disciples called him the Christ (the anointed), that is to\\nsay, the king consecrated by the holy oil.', 'He was also called the Master, the\\nLord, and the Saviour. The religion that he came to found is that we now\\npossess. We all know his life: it is the model of every Christian.', 'We know\\nhis instructions by heart; they form our moral law. It is sufficient, then, to\\nindicate what new doctrines he disseminated in the world. Charity.', 'â€”Before all, Christ commended love. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy\\nGod with all thy heart and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.', '\" The first\\nduty is to love others and to benefit them. When God will judge men, he\\nwill set on his right hand those who have fed the hungry, given drink to\\nthose who were thirsty, and have clad those that were naked. To those who\\nwould follow him the Christ said at the beginning: \"Go,.', 'sell all that ye\\nhave and give to the poor. \"\\nFor the ancients the good man was the noble, the rich, the brave. Since the\\ntime of Christ the word has changed its sense: the good man is he who\\nloves others.', 'Doing good is loving others and seeking to be of service to\\nthem. Charity (the Latin name of love) from that time has been the cardinal\\nvirtue. Charitable becomes synonymous with beneficent.', 'To the old\\ndoctrine of vengeance the Christ formally opposes his doctrine of charity. \"Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth;\\nbut I say unto you. whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to\\nhim the other also.', 'Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love\\nthy neighbor and hate thine enemy; but I say unto you love your enemies,\\ndo good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you,. that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who maketh\\nhis sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and\\nthe unjust. \" He himself on the cross prayed for his executioners, \"Father,\\nforgive them, for they know not what they do.', '\"\\nEquality. â€”The Christ loved all men; he died not for one people only, but\\nfor all humanity. He never made a difference between men; all are equal\\nbefore God.', 'The ancient religions, even the Jewish, were religions of\\npeoples who kept them with jealous care, as a treasure, without wishing to\\ncommunicate them to other peoples. Christ said to his disciples, \"Go, and\\nteach all nations. \" And the apostle Paul thus formulated the doctrine of\\nChristian equality: \"There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor\\nuncircumcision, barbarian, bond nor free.', '\" Two centuries later Tertullian, a\\nChristian writer, said, \"The world is a republic, the common land of the\\nhuman race. \"\\nPoverty and Humility. â€”The ancients thought that riches ennobled a man\\nand they regarded pride as a worthy sentiment.', '\"Blessed are the poor,\" said\\nChrist, \"for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \" He that would not renounce\\nall that he had could not be his disciple. He himself went from city to city,\\npossessing nothing, and when his disciples were preoccupied with the\\nfuture, he said, \"Be not anxious for what ye shall eat, nor for what ye shall\\nput on.', 'Behold the birds of the heaven, they sow not neither do they reap,\\nyet your heavenly Father feedeth them. \"\\nThe Christian was to disdain riches, and more yet, worldly honors. One\\nday when his disciples were disputing who should have the highest rank\\nin heaven, he said, \"He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.', '\"\\n\"Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself\\nshall be exalted. \" Till our day the successor of Saint Peter calls himself\\n\"Servant of the servants of God. \" Christ drew to himself by preference the\\npoor, the sick, women, children,â€”in a word, the weak and the helpless.', 'He\\ntook all his disciples from among the populace and bade them be \"meek\\nand lowly of heart. \"\\nThe Kingdom of God. â€”Christ said that he had come to the earth to found\\nthe kingdom of God.', 'His enemies believed that he wished to be a king, and\\nwhen he was crucified, they placed this inscription on his cross, \"Jesus of\\nNazareth, king of the Jews. \" This was a gross mistake. Christ himself had\\ndeclared, \"My kingdom is not of this world.', '\" He did not come to overturn\\ngovernments nor to reform society. To him who asked if he should pay the\\nRoman tax, he replied, \"Render unto CÃ¦sar the things that are CÃ¦sar\\'s, and\\nto God the things that are God\\'s. \" And so the Christian accepted what he\\nfound established and himself worked to perfect it, not to remodel society.', 'To make himself pleasing to God and worthy of his kingdom it was not\\nnecessary to offer him sacrifices or to observe minute formulas as the\\npagans did: \"True worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and\\ntruth. \" Their moral law is contained in this word of Christ: \"Be ye therefore\\nperfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. \"\\nTHE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHURCH\\nDisciples and Apostles.', 'â€”The twelve disciples who associated with Christ\\nreceived from him the mission to preach his doctrine to all peoples. From\\nthat time they were called Apostles. The majority of them lived in\\nJerusalem and preached in JudÃ¦a; the first Christians were still Jews.', 'It was\\nSaul, a new convert, who carried Christianity to the other peoples of the\\nOrient. Paul (for he took this name) spent his life visiting the Greek cities of\\nAsia, Greece, and Macedonia, inviting to the new religion not only the\\nJews, but also and especially the Gentiles: \"You were once without Christ,\"\\nsaid he to them, \"strangers to the covenant and to the promises; but you\\nhave been brought nigh by the blood of Christ, for it is he who of two\\npeoples hath made both one. \" From this time it was no longer necessary to\\nbe a Jew if one would become a Christian.', 'The other nations, disregarded\\nby the law of Moses, are brought near by the law of Christ. This fusion was\\nthe work of St. Paul, also called the Apostle to the Gentiles.', 'The religion of Christ spread very slowly, as he himself had announced:\\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed. which is the least\\nof all seeds; but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs. and the\\nbirds of the air lodge under its branches.', '\"\\nThe Church. â€”In every city where Christians were found they assembled to\\npray together, to sing the praises of God, and to celebrate the mystery of\\nthe Lord\\'s Supper. Their meeting was called Ecclesia (assembly).', 'Usually\\nthe Christians of the same assembly regarded themselves as brothers; they\\ncontributed of their property to support the widows, the poor, and the sick. The most eminent directed the community and celebrated the religious\\nceremonies. These were the Priests (their name signifies \"elders\").', 'Others\\nwere charged with the administration of the goods of the community, and\\nwere called Deacons (servants). Besides these officers, there was in each\\ncity a supreme headâ€”the Bishop (overseer). Later the functions of the church became so exacting that the body of\\nChristians was divided into two classes of people: the clergy, who were the\\nofficials of the community; the rest, the faithful, who were termed the laity.', 'Each city had its independent church; thus they spoke of the church of\\nAntioch, of Corinth, of Rome; and yet they all formed but one church, the\\nchurch of Christ, in which all were united in one faith. The universal or\\nCatholic faith was regarded as the only correct body of belief; all conflicting\\nopinions (the heresies) were condemned as errors. The Sacred Books.', 'â€”The sacred scripture of the Jews, the Old Testament,\\nremained sacred for the Christians, but they had other sacred books which\\nthe church had brought into one structure (the New Testament). The four\\nGospels recount the life of Christ and the \"good news\" of salvation which\\nhe brought. The Acts of the Apostles describes how the gospel was\\ndisseminated in the world.', 'The Epistles are the letters addressed by the\\napostles to the Christians of the first century. The Apocalypse (Revelation)\\nis the revelation made through St. John to the seven churches of Asia.', 'Many other pseudo-sacred books were current among the Christians, but\\nthe church has rejected all of these, and has termed them apocryphal. The Persecutions. â€”The Christian religion was persecuted from its birth.', 'Its\\nfirst enemies were the Jews, who forced the Roman governor of JudÃ¦a to\\ncrucify Christ; who stoned St. Stephen, the first martyr, and so set\\nthemselves against St. Paul that they almost compassed his death.', 'Then came the persecution by the Pagans. The Romans tolerated all the\\nreligions of the East because the devotees of Osiris, of Mithra, and of the\\nGood Goddess recognized at the same time the Roman gods. But the\\nChristians, worshippers of the living God, scorned the petty divinities of\\nantiquity.', 'More serious still in the eyes of the Romans, they refused to\\nadore the emperor as a god and to burn incense on the altar of the goddess\\nRoma. Several emperors promulgated edicts against the Christians,\\nbidding the governors arrest them and put them to death. A letter of Pliny\\nthe Younger, then governor in Asia, to the emperor Trajan, shows the\\nprocedure against them.', '\"Up to this time, regarding the people who have\\nbeen denounced as Christians, I have always operated as follows: I asked\\nthem if they were Christians; if they confessed it, I put the question to them\\na second time, and then a third time, threatening them with the penalty of\\ndeath. When they persisted, I had them put to death, convinced that,\\nwhatever their fault that they avowed, their disobedience and their resolute\\nobstinacy merited punishment. Many who have been denounced in\\nanonymous writings have denied that they were Christians, have repeated\\na prayer that I pronounced before them, have offered wine and incense to\\nyour statue, which I had set forth for this purpose together with the statues\\nof the gods, and have even reviled the name of Christ.', 'All these are things\\nwhich it is not possible to compel any true Christians to do. Others have\\nconfessed that they were Christians, but they affirm that their crime and\\ntheir error consisted only in assembling on certain days before sunrise to\\nadore Christ as God, to sing together in his honor, and to bind themselves\\nby oath to commit no crime, to perpetrate no theft, murder, adultery, nor to\\nviolate their word. I have believed it necessary in order to secure the truth\\nto put to the torture two female slaves whom they called deaconesses; but I\\nhave discovered only an absurd and exaggerated superstition.', '\"\\nThe Roman government was a persecutor, but the populace were severer\\nyet. They could not endure these people who worshipped another god than\\ntheirs and contemned their deities. Whenever famine or epidemic occurred,\\nthe well-known cry was heard, \"To the lions with the Christians!\" The\\npeople forced the magistrates to hunt and persecute the Christians.', 'The Martyrs. â€”For the two centuries and a half that the Christians were\\npersecuted, throughout the empire there were thousands of victims, of\\nevery age, sex, and condition. Roman citizens, like St.', 'Paul, were beheaded;\\nthe others were crucified, burned, most often sent to the beasts in the\\namphitheatre. If they were allowed to escape with their lives, they were set\\nat forced labor in the mines. Sometimes torture was aggravated by every\\nsort of invention.', 'In the great execution at Lyons, in 177, the Christians,\\nafter being tortured and confined in narrow prison quarters, were brought\\nto the arena. The beasts mutilated without killing them. They were then\\nseated in iron chairs heated red by fire.', 'Blandina, a young slave, who\\nsurvived all these torments was bound with cords and exposed to the fury\\nof a bull. The Christians joyfully suffered these persecutions which gave\\nthem entrance to heaven. The occasion presented an opportunity for\\nrendering public testimony to Christ.', 'And so they did not call themselves\\nvictims, but martyrs (witnesses); their torture was a testimony. They\\ncompared it to the combat of the Olympian games; like the victor in the\\nathletic contests, they spoke of the palm or the crown. Even now the festal\\nday of a martyr is the day of his death.', 'Frequently a Christian who was present at the persecution would draft a\\nwritten account of the martyrdomâ€”he related the arrest, the examination,\\nthe tortures, and the death. These brief accounts, filled with edifying\\ndetails, were called The Acts of the Martyrs. They were circulated in the\\nremotest communities; from one end of the empire to the other they\\npublished the glory of the martyrs and excited a desire to imitate them.', 'Thousands of the faithful, seized by a thirst for martyrdom, pressed\\nforward to incriminate themselves and to demand condemnation. One day\\na governor of Asia had decreed persecutions against some Christians: all\\nthe Christians of the city presented themselves in his tribunal and\\ndemanded to be persecuted. The governor, exasperated, had some of them\\nexecuted and sent away the others.', '\"Begone, you wretches! If you are so\\nbent on death, you have precipices and ropes. \" Some of the faithful, to be\\nsurer of torture, entered the temples and threw down the idols of the gods. It was several times necessary for even the church to prohibit the\\nsolicitation of martyrdom.', 'The Catacombs. â€”The ancient custom of burning the dead was repugnant\\nto the Christians. Like the Jews, they interred their dead wrapped with a\\nshroud in a sarcophagus.', 'Cemeteries were therefore required. At Rome\\nwhere land was very high in price the Christians went below ground, and\\nin the brittle tufa on which Rome was built may be seen long galleries and\\nsubterranean chambers. There, in niches excavated along the passages,\\nthey laid the bodies of their dead.', 'As each generation excavated new\\ngalleries, there was formed at length a subterranean city, called the\\nCatacombs (\"to the tombs\"). There were similar catacombs in several\\ncitiesâ€”Naples, Milan, Alexandria, but the most celebrated were those in\\nRome. These have been investigated in our day and thousands of Christian\\ntombs and inscriptions recovered.', 'The discovery of this subterranean\\nworld gave birth to a new department of historical scienceâ€”Christian\\nEpigraphy and ArchÃ¦ology. The sepulchral halls of the catacombs do not resemble those of the\\nEgyptians or those of the Etruscans; they are bare and severe. The\\nChristians knew that a corpse had no bodily wants and so they did not\\nadorn the tombs.', 'The most important halls are decorated with very simple\\nornaments and paintings which almost always represent the same scenes. The most common subjects are the faithful in prayer, and the Good\\nShepherd, symbolical of Christ. Some of these halls were like chapels.', 'In\\nthem were interred the bodies of the holy martyrs and the faithful who\\nwished to lie near them; every year Christians came here to celebrate the\\nmysteries. During the persecutions of the third century the Christians of\\nRome often took refuge in these subterranean chapels to hold their services\\nof worship, or to escape from pursuit. The Christians could feel safe in this\\nbewildering labyrinth of galleries whose entrance was usually marked by a\\npagan tomb.', 'THE MONKS OF THE THIRD CENTURY\\nThe Solitaries. â€”It was an idea current among Christians, especially in the\\nEast, that one could not become a perfect Christian by remaining in the\\nmidst of other men. Christ himself had said, \"If any man come to me and\\nhate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and\\nsisters.', 'he cannot be my disciple. \" The faithful man or woman who thus\\nwithdrew from the world to work out his salvation the more surely, was\\ntermed an Anchorite (the man who is set apart), or a Monk (solitary). This\\ncustom began in the East in the middle of the third century.', 'The first\\nanchorites established themselves in the deserts and the ruins of the district\\nof Thebes in Upper Egypt, which remained the holy land of the solitaries. Paul (235-340), the oldest of the monks, lived to his ninetieth year in a\\ngrotto near a spring and a palm-tree which furnished him with food and\\nclothing. The model of the monks was St Anthony.', 'At the age of twenty he\\nheard read one day the text of the gospel, \"If thou wilt be perfect, sell all\\nthy goods and give to the poor. \" He was fine looking, noble, and rich,\\nhaving received an inheritance from his parents. He sold all his property,\\ndistributed it in alms and buried himself in the desert of Egypt.', 'He first\\nbetook himself to an empty tomb, then to the ruins of a fortress; he was\\nclad in a hair-shirt, had for food only the bread that was brought to him\\nevery six months, fasted, starved himself, prayed day and night. Often\\nsunrise found him still in prayer. \"O sun,\" cried he, \"why hast thou risen\\nand prevented my contemplating the true light?\" He felt himself\\nsurrounded by demons, who, under every form, sought to distract him\\nfrom his religious thoughts.', 'When he became old and revered by all Egypt,\\nhe returned to Alexandria for a day to preach against the Arian heretics,\\nbut soon repaired to the desert again. They besought him to remain: he\\nreplied, \"The fishes die on land, the monks waste away in the city; we\\nreturn to our mountains like the fish to the water. \"\\nWomen also became solitaries.', 'Alexandra, one of these, shut herself in an\\nempty tomb and lived there for ten years without leaving it to see anybody. Asceticism. â€”These men who had withdrawn to the desert to escape the\\nworld thought that everything that came from the world turned the soul\\nfrom God and placed it in the peril of losing salvation.', 'The Christian ought\\nto belong entirely to God; he should forget everything behind him. \"Do you\\nnot know,\" said St. Nilus later, \"that it is a trap of Satan to be too much\\nattached to one\\'s family?\" The monk Poemen had withdrawn to the desert\\nwith his brothers, and their mother came to visit them.', 'As they refused to\\nappear, she waited a little until they were going to the church; but on\\nseeing her, they fled and would not consent to speak to her unless they\\nwere concealed. She asked to see them, but they consoled her by saying,\\n\"You will see us in the other world. \"\\nBut the world is not the only danger for the monk.', 'Every man carried\\nabout with himself an enemy from whom he could not deliver himself as\\nhe had delivered himself from the worldâ€”that is, his own body. The body\\nprevented the soul from rising to God and drew it to worldly pleasures\\nthat came from the devil. And so the solitaries applied themselves to\\novercoming the body by refusing to it everything that it loved.', 'They\\nsubsisted only on bread and water; many ate but twice a week, some went\\nto the mountains to cut herbs which they ate raw. They dwelt in grottoes,\\nruins, and tombs, lying on the earth or on a mat of rushes. The most\\nzealous of them added other tortures to mortify, or kill, the body.', 'St. Pachomius for fifteen years slept only in an erect position, leaning against a\\nwall. Macarius remained six months in a morass, the prey of mosquitoes\\n\"whose stings would have penetrated the hide of a wild boar.', '\" The most\\nnoted of these monks was St. Simeon, surnamed Stylites (the man of the\\ncolumn). For forty years he lived in the desert of Arabia on the summit of a\\ncolumn, exposed to the sun and the rain, compelling himself to stay in one\\nposition for a whole day; the faithful flocked from afar to behold him; he\\ngave them audience from the top of his column, bidding creditors free their\\ndebtors, and masters liberate their slaves; he even sent reproaches to\\nministers and counsellors of the emperor.', 'This form of life was called\\nAsceticism (exercise). The Cenobites. â€”The solitaries who lived in the same desert drew together\\nand adopted a common life for the practice of their austerities.', 'About St. Anthony were already assembled many anchorites who gave him their\\nobedience. St.', 'Pachomius (272-348) in this way assembled 3,000. Their\\nestablishment was at Tabenna, near the first cataract of the Nile. He\\nfounded many other similar communities, either of men or women.', 'In 256\\na traveller said he had seen in a single city of Egypt 10,000 monks and\\n20,000 vowed to a religious life. There were more of them in Syria, in\\nPalestine, in all the Orient. The monks thus united in communities became\\nCenobites (people who live in common).', 'They chose a chief, the abbot (the\\nword signifies in Syriac \"father\"), and they implicitly obeyed him. Cassian\\nrelates that in one community in Egypt he had seen the abbot before the\\nwhole refectory give a cenobite a violent blow on the head to try his\\nobedience. The primitive monks renounced all property and family relations; the\\ncenobites surrendered also their will.', 'On entering the community they\\nengaged to possess nothing, not to marry, and to obey. \"The monks,\" says\\nSt. Basil, \"live a spiritual life like the angels.', '\" The first union among the\\ncenobites was the construction of houses in close proximity. Later each\\ncommunity built a monastery, a great edifice, where each monk had his\\ncell. A Christian compares these cells \"to a hive of bees where each has in\\nhis hands the wax of work, in his mouth the honey of psalms and prayers.', '\"\\nThese great houses needed a written constitution; this was the Monastic\\nRule. St. Pachomius was the first to prepare one.', 'St. Basil wrote another\\nthat was adopted by almost all the monasteries of the Orient. CHAPTER XXVII\\nTHE LATER EMPIRE\\nTHE REVOLUTIONS OF THE THIRD CENTURY\\nMilitary Anarchy.', 'â€”After the reigns of the Antonines the civil wars\\ncommenced. There were in the empire, beside the prÃ¦torian guard in\\nRome, several great armies on the Rhine, on the Danube, in the East, and in\\nEngland. Each aimed to make its general emperor.', 'Ordinarily the rivals\\nfought it out until there was but one left; this one then governed for a few\\nyears, after which he was assassinated, or if, by chance, he could transmit\\nhis power to his son, the soldiers revolted against the son and the war\\nrecommenced. The following, for example, is what occurred in 193. The\\nprÃ¦torians had massacred the emperor Pertinax, and the army conceived\\nthe notion of putting up the empire at auction; two purchasers presented\\nthemselves, Sulpicius offering each soldier $1,000 and Didius more than\\n$1,200.', 'The prÃ¦torians brought the latter to the Senate and had him named\\nemperor; later, when he did not pay them, they murdered him. At the same\\ntime the great armies of Britain, Illyricum, and Syria proclaimed each its\\nown general as emperor and the three rivals marched on Rome. The\\nIllyrian legions arrived first, and their general Septimius Severus was\\nnamed emperor by the Senate.', 'Then commenced two sanguinary wars, the\\none against the legions of Syria, and the other against the legions of Britain. At the end of two years the emperor was victorious. It is he who states his\\npolicy as follows, \"My son, content the soldiers and you may despise the\\nrest.', '\" For a century there was no other form of government than the will of\\nthe soldiers. They killed the emperors who displeased them and replaced\\nthem by their favorites. Strange emperors, therefore, occupied the throne: Elagabalus, a Syrian\\npriest, who garbed himself as a woman and had his mother assemble a\\nsenate of women; Maximin, a soldier of fortune, a rough and bloodthirsty\\ngiant, who ate, it was said, thirty pounds of food and drank twenty-one\\nquarts of wine a day.', 'Once there were twenty emperors at the same time,\\neach in a corner of the empire (260-278). These have been called the Thirty\\nTyrants. The Cult of Mithra.', 'â€”This century of wars is also a century of superstitions. The deities of the Orient, Isis, Osiris, the Great Mother, have their devotees\\neverywhere. But, more than all the others, Mithra, a Persian god, becomes\\nthe universal god of the empire.', 'Mithra is no other than the sun. The\\nmonuments in his honor that are found in all parts of the empire represent\\nhim slaughtering a bull, with this inscription: \"To the unconquerable sun,\\nto the god Mithra. \" His cult is complicated, sometimes similar to the\\nChristian worship; there are a baptism, sacred feasts, an anointing,\\npenances, and chapels.', 'To be admitted to this one must pass through an\\ninitiatory ceremony, through fasting and certain fearful tests. At the end of the third century the religion of Mithra was the official\\nreligion of the empire. The Invincible God was the god of the emperors; he\\nhad his chapels everywhere in the form of grottoes with altars and basreliefs; in Rome, even, he had a magnificent temple erected by the emperor\\nAurelian.', 'The Taurobolia. â€”One of the most urgent needs of this time was\\nreconciliation with the deity; and so ceremonies of purification were\\ninvented. The most striking of these was the Taurobolia.', 'The devotee, clad in a white\\nrobe with ornaments of gold, takes his place in the bottom of a ditch which\\nis covered by a platform pierced with holes. A bull is led over this\\nplatform, the priest kills him and his blood runs through the holes of the\\nplatform upon the garments, the face, and the hair of the worshipper. It\\nwas believed that this \"baptism of blood\" purified one of all sins.', 'He who\\nhad received it was born to a new life; he came forth from the ditch\\nhideous to look upon, but happy and envied. Confusion of Religions. â€”In the century that preceded the victory of\\nChristianity, all religions fell into confusion.', 'The sun was adored at once\\nunder many names (Sol, Helios, Baal, Elagabal, and Mithra). All the cults\\nimitated one another and sometimes copied Christian forms. Even the life\\nof Christ was copied.', 'The Asiatic philosopher, Apollonius of Tyana, who\\nlived in the first century (3-96), became in legend a kind of prophet, son of\\na god, who went about surrounded by his disciples, expelling demons,\\ncuring sicknesses, raising the dead. He had come, it was said, to reform the\\ndoctrine of Pythagoras and Plato. In the third century an empress had the\\nlife of Apollonius of Tyana written, to be, as it were, a Pythagorean gospel\\nopposed to the gospel of Christ.', 'The most remarkable example of this\\nconfusion in religion was given by Alexander Severus, a devout emperor,\\nmild and conscientious: he had in his palace a chapel where he adored the\\nbenefactors of humanityâ€”Abraham, Orpheus, Jesus, and Apollonius of\\nTyana. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE LATER EMPIRE\\nReforms of Diocletian and Constantine. â€”After a century of civil wars\\nemperors were found who were able to stop the anarchy.', 'They were men\\nof the people, rude and active, soldiers of fortune rising from one grade to\\nanother to become generals-in-chief, and then emperors. Almost all arose\\nin the semi-barbarous provinces of the Danube and of Illyria; some in their\\ninfancy had been shepherds or peasants. They had the simple manners of\\nthe old Roman generals.', 'When the envoys of the king of Persia asked to see\\nthe emperor Probus, they found a bald old man clad in a linen cassock,\\nlying on the ground, who ate peas and bacon. It was the story of Curius\\nDentatus repeated after five centuries. Severe with their soldiers, these emperors reÃ«stablished discipline in the\\narmy, and then order in the empire.', 'But a change had become necessary. A\\nsingle man was no longer adequate to the government and defence of this\\nimmense territory; and so from this time each emperor took from among\\nhis relatives or his friends two or three collaborators, each charged with a\\npart of the empire. Usually their title was that of CÃ¦sar, but sometimes\\nthere were two equal emperors, and both had the title of Augustus.', 'When\\nthe emperor died, one of the CÃ¦sars succeeded him; it was no longer\\npossible for the army to create emperors. The provinces were too great, and\\nDiocletian divided them. The prÃ¦torians of Rome being dangerous,\\nDiocletian replaced them with two legions.', 'The Occident was in ruins and\\ndepopulated and hence the Orient had become the important part of the\\nempire; Diocletian, therefore, abandoned Rome and established his capital\\nat Nicomedia in Asia Minor. Constantine did more and founded a new\\nRome in the Eastâ€”Constantinople. Constantinople.', \"â€”On a promontory where Europe is separated from Asia\\nonly by the narrow channel of the Bosporus, in a country of vineyards and\\nrich harvests, under a beautiful sky, Greek colonists had founded the town\\nof Byzantium. The hills of the vicinity made the place easily defensible; its\\nport, the Golden Horn, one of the best in the world, could shelter 1,200\\nships, and a chain of 820 feet in length was all that was necessary to\\nexclude a hostile fleet. This was the site of Constantine's new city,\\nConstantinople (the city of Constantine).\", 'Around the city were strong walls; two public squares surrounded with\\nporticos were constructed; a palace was erected, a circus, theatres,\\naqueducts, baths, temples, and a Christian church. To ornament his city\\nConstantine transferred from other cities the most celebrated statues and\\nbas-reliefs. To furnish it with population he forced the people of the\\nneighboring towns to remove to it, and offered rewards and honors to the\\ngreat families who would come hither to make their home.', 'He established,\\nas in Rome, distributions of grain, of wine, of oil, and provided a\\ncontinuous round of shows. This was one of those rapid transformations,\\nalmost fantastic, in which the Orient delights. The task began the 4th of\\nNovember, 326; on the 11th of May, 330, the city was dedicated.', 'But it was\\na permanent creation. For ten centuries Constantinople resisted invasions,\\npreserving always in the ruins of the empire its rank of capital. Today it is\\nstill the first city of the East.', 'The Palace. â€”The emperors who dwelt in the East adopted the customs of\\nthe Orient, wearing delicate garments of silk and gold and for a head-dress\\na diadem of pearls. They secluded themselves in the depths of their palace\\nwhere they sat on a throne of gold, surrounded by their ministers,\\nseparated from the world by a crowd of courtiers, servants, functionaries\\nand military guards.', \"One must prostrate one's self before them with face to\\nthe earth in token of adoration; they were called Lord and Majesty; they\\nwere treated as gods. Everything that touched their person was sacred, and\\nso men spoke of the sacred palace, the sacred bed-chamber, the sacred\\nCouncil of State, even the sacred treasury. The rÃ©gime of this period has been termed that of the Later Empire as\\ndistinguished from that of the three preceding centuries, which we call the\\nEarly Empire.\", 'The life of an emperor of the Early Empire (from the first to the third\\ncentury) was still that of a magistrate and a general; the palace of an\\nemperor of the Later Empire became similar to the court of the Persian\\nking. The Officials. â€”The officials often became very numerous.', 'Diocletian found\\nthe provinces too large and so made several divisions of them. In Gaul, for\\nexample, Lugdunensis (the province about Lyons) was partitioned into\\nfour, Aquitaine into three. In place of forty-six governors there were from\\nthis time 117.', 'At the same time the duties of the officials were divided. Besides the\\ngovernors and the deputies in the provinces there were in the border\\nprovinces military commandersâ€”the dukes and the counts. The emperor\\nhad about him a small picked force to guard the palace, body-guards,\\nchamberlains, assistants, domestics, a council of state, bailiffs, messengers,\\nand a whole body of secretaries organized in four bureaus.', 'All these officials did not now receive their orders directly from the\\nemperor; they communicated with him only through their superior\\nofficers. The governors were subordinate to the two prÃ¦torian prefects, the\\nofficials of public works to the two prefects of the city, the collectors of\\ntaxes to the Count of the Sacred Largesses, the deputies to the Count of the\\nDomains, all the officers of the palace to the Master of the Offices, the\\ndomestics of the court to the Chamberlain. These heads of departments had\\nthe character of ministers.', 'This system is not very difficult for us to comprehend. We are accustomed\\nto see officials, judges, generals, collectors, and engineers, organized in\\ndistinct departments, each with his special duty, and subordinated to the\\ncommands of a chief of the service. We even have more ministers than\\nthere were in Constantinople; but this administrative machine which has\\nbecome so familiar to us because we have been acquainted with it from our\\ninfancy, is none the less complicated and unnatural.', 'It is the Later Empire\\nthat gave us the first model of this; the Byzantine empire preserved it and\\nsince that time all absolute governments have been forced to imitate it\\nbecause it has made the work of government easier for those who have it to\\ndo. Society in the Later Empire. â€”The Later Empire is a decisive moment in the\\nhistory of civilization.', 'The absolute power of the Roman magistrate is\\nunited to the pompous ceremonial of the eastern kings to create a power\\nunknown before in history. This new imperial majesty crushes everything\\nbeneath it; the inhabitants of the empire cease to be citizens and from the\\nfourth century are called in Latin \"subjects\" and in Greek \"slaves. \" In reality\\nall are slaves of the emperor, but there are different grades of servitude.', 'There are various degrees of nobility which the master confers on them and\\nwhich they transmit to their posterity. The following is the series:\\n1. The Nobilissimi (the very noble); these are the imperial family;\\n2.', 'The Illustres (the notable)â€”the chief ministers of departments;\\n3. The Spectabiles (the eminent)â€”the high dignitaries;\\n4. The Clarissimi (most renowned)â€”the great officials, also sometimes\\ncalled senators;\\n5.', 'The Perfectissimi (very perfect). Every important man has his rank, his title, and his functions. The only\\nmen who are of consequence are the courtiers and officials; it is the rÃ©gime\\nof titles and of etiquette.', 'A clearer instance has never been given of the\\nissue of absolute power united with the mania for titles and with the\\npurpose to regulate everything. The Later Empire exhibits the completed\\ntype of a society reduced to a machine and of a government absorbed by a\\ncourt. It realized the ideal that is proposed today by the partisans of\\nabsolute power; and for a long time the friends of liberty must fight against\\nthe traditions which the Later Empire has left to us.', 'THE CHURCH AND THE STATE\\nTriumph of Christianity. â€”During the first two centuries of our era the\\nChristians occupied but a small place in the empire. Almost all of them\\nwere of the lower classes, workmen, freedmen, slaves, who lived obscure\\nlives in the multitude of the great cities.', 'For a long time the aristocracy\\nignored the Christians; even in the second century Suetonius in his \"Lives\\nof the Twelve CÃ¦sars\" speaks of a certain Chrestus who agitated the\\npopulace of Rome. When the religion first concerned the world of the rich\\nand cultivated people, they were interested simply to deride it as one only\\nfor the poor and ignorant. It was precisely because it addressed the poor of\\nthis world in providing a compensation in the life to come that Christianity\\nmade so many proselytes.', 'Persecution, far from suppressing it, gave it\\nmore force. \"The blood of the martyrs,\" said the faithful, \"is the seed of the\\nchurch. \" During the whole of the third century conversions continued, not\\nonly among the poor, but among the aristocracy as well.', 'At the first of the\\nfourth century all the East had become Christian. Helena, the mother of\\nConstantine, was a Christian and has been canonized by the church. When\\nConstantine marched against his rival, he took for his ensign a standard\\n(the labarum), which bore the cross and the monogram of Christ.', 'His\\nvictory was the victory of the Christians. He allowed them now to perform\\ntheir religious rites freely (by the edict of 313), and later he favored them\\nopenly. Yet he did not break with the ancient religion: while he presided at\\nthe great assembly of the Christian bishops, he continued to hold the title\\nof Pontifex Maximus; he carried in his helmet a nail of the true cross and on\\nhis coins he still had the sun-god represented.', 'In his city of Constantinople\\nhe had a Christian church built, but also a temple to Victory. For a halfcentury it was difficult to know what was the official religion of the empire. Organization of the Church.', 'â€”The Christians even under persecution had\\nnever dreamed of overthrowing the empire. As soon as persecution ceased,\\nthe bishops became the allies of the emperors. Then the Christian church\\nwas organized definitively, and it was organized on the model of the Later\\nEmpire, in the form that it preserves to this day.', 'Each city had a bishop\\nwho resided in the city proper and governed the people of the territory;\\nthis territory subject to the bishop was termed a Diocese. In any country in\\nthe Later Empire, there were as many bishops and dioceses as there were\\ncities. This is why the bishops were so numerous and dioceses so many in\\nthe East and in Italy where the country was covered with cities.', 'In Gaul, on\\nthe contrary, there were but 120 dioceses between the Rhine and the\\nPyrenees, and the most of these, save in the south, were of the size of a\\nmodern French department. Each province became an ecclesiastical\\nprovince; the bishop of the capital (metropolis) became the metropolitan, or\\nas he was later termed, the archbishop. The Councils.', 'â€”In this century began the councils, the great assemblies of\\nthe church. There had already been some local councils at which the\\nbishops and priests of a single province had been present. For the first time,\\nin 324, Constantine convoked a General Assembly of the World (an\\necumenical council) at NicÃ¦a, in Asia Minor; 318 ecclesiastics were in\\nattendance.', 'They discussed questions of theology and drew up the Nicene\\nCreed, the Catholic confession of faith. Then the emperor wrote to all the\\nchurches, bidding them \"conform to the will of God as expressed by the\\ncouncil. \" This was the first ecumenical council, and there were three others\\nof these before the arrival of the barbarians made an assembly of the whole\\nchurch impossible.', 'The decisions reached by these councils had the force of\\nlaw for all Christians: the decisions are called Canons (rules). The collection\\nof these regulations constitutes the Canon Law. The Heretics.', 'â€”From the second century there were among the Christians\\nheretics who professed opinions contrary to those of the majority of the\\nchurch. Often the bishops of a country assembled to pronounce the new\\nteaching as false, to compel the author to abjure, and, if he refused, to\\nseparate him from the communion of Christians. But frequently the author\\nof the heresy had partisans convinced of the truth of his teaching who\\nwould not submit and continued to profess the condemned opinions.', 'This\\nwas the cause of hatred and violent strife between them and the faithful\\nwho were attached to the creed of the church (the orthodox). As long as the\\nChristians were weak and persecuted by the state, they fought among\\nthemselves only with words and with books; but when all society was\\nChristian, the contests against the heretics turned into persecutions, and\\nsometimes into civil wars. Almost all of the heresies of this time arose among the Greeks of Asia or\\nEgypt, peoples who were subtle, sophistical, and disputatious.', 'The heresies\\nwere usually attempts to explain the mysteries of the Trinity and of the\\nIncarnation. The most significant of these heresies was that of Arius; he\\ntaught that Christ was created by God the Father and was not equal to him. The Council of NicÃ¦a condemned this view, but his doctrine, called\\nArianism, spread throughout the East.', 'From that time for two centuries\\nCatholics and Arians fought to see who should have the supremacy in the\\nchurch; the stronger party anathematized, exiled, imprisoned, and\\nsometimes killed the chiefs of the opposition. For a long time the Arians\\nhad the advantage; several emperors took sides with them; then, too, as the\\nbarbarians entered the empire, they were converted to Arianism and\\nreceived Arian bishops. More than two centuries had passed before the\\nCatholics had overcome this heresy.', 'Paganism. â€”The ancient religion of the Gentiles did not disappear at a\\nsingle stroke. The Orient was quickly converted; but in the Occident there\\nwere few Christians outside the cities, and even there many continued to\\nworship idols.', 'The first Christian emperors did not wish to break with the\\nancient imperial religion; they simultaneously protected the bishops of the\\nChristians and the priests of the gods; they presided over councils and yet\\nremained pontifex maximus. One of them, Julian (surnamed the Apostate),\\nopenly returned to the ancient religion. The emperor Gratian in 384was the\\nfirst to refuse the insignia of the pontifex maximus.', 'But as intolerance was\\ngeneral in this century, as soon as the Roman religion ceased to be official,\\nmen began to persecute it. The sacred fire of Rome that had burned for\\neleven centuries was extinguished, the Vestals were removed, the\\nOlympian games were celebrated for the last time in 394. Then the monks\\nof Egypt issued from their deserts to destroy the altars of the false gods and\\nto establish relics in the temples of Anubis and Serapis.', 'Marcellus, a bishop\\nof Syria, at the head of a band of soldiers and gladiators sacked the temple\\nof Jupiter at AparnÃ¦a and set himself to scour the country for the\\ndestruction of the sanctuaries; he was killed by the peasants and raised by\\nthe church to the honor of a saint. Soon idolatry persisted only in the rural districts where it escaped\\ndetection; the idolaters were peasants who continued to adore sacred trees\\nand fountains and to assemble in proscribed sanctuaries. The Christians\\ncommenced to call \"pagans\" (the peasants) those whom up to this time they\\nhad called Gentiles.', 'And this name has still clung to them. Paganism thus\\nled an obscure existence in Italy, in Gaul, and in Spain down to the end of\\nthe sixth century. Theodosius.', 'â€”The incursions of the Germanic peoples into the empire\\ncontinued for two centuries until the Huns, a people of Tartar horsemen,\\ncame from the steppes of Asia, and threw themselves on the Germans, who\\noccupied the country to the north of the Danube. In that country there was\\nalready a great German kingdom, that of the Goths, who had been\\nconverted to Christianity by Ulfilas, an Arian. To escape the Huns, a part of\\nthis people, the West Goths (Visigoths), fled into Roman territory, defeated\\nthe Roman armies, and overspread the country even to Greece.', 'Valens, the\\nemperor of the East, had perished in the defeat of Adrianople (378);\\nGratian, the emperor of the West, took as colleague a noble Spaniard,\\nTheodosius by name, and gave him the title of Augustus of the East (379). Theodosius was able to rehabilitate his army by avoiding a great battle\\nwith the Visigoths and by making a war of skirmishes against them; this\\ndecided them to conclude a treaty. They accepted service under the empire,\\nland was given them in the country to the south of the Danube, and they\\nwere charged with preventing the enemies of the empire from crossing the\\nriver.', 'Theodosius, having reÃ«stablished peace in the East, came to the West\\nwhere Gratian had been killed by order of the usurper Maximus (383). This\\nMaximus was the commander of the Roman army of Britain; he had\\ncrossed into Gaul with his army, abandoning the Roman provinces of\\nBritain to the ravages of the highland Scotch, had defeated Gratian, and\\ninvaded Italy. He was master of the West, Theodosius of the East.', 'The\\ncontest between them was not only one between persons; it was a battle\\nbetween two religions: Theodosius was Catholic and had assembled a\\ncouncil at Constantinople to condemn the heresy of Arius (381); Maximus\\nwas ill-disposed toward the church. The engagement occurred on the\\nbanks of the Save; Maximus was defeated, taken, and executed. Theodosius established Valentinian II, the son of Gratian, in the West and\\nthen returned to the East.', 'But Arbogast, a barbarian Frank, the general of\\nthe troops of Valentinian, had the latter killed, and without venturing to\\nproclaim himself emperor since he was not a Roman, had his Roman\\nsecretary Eugenius made emperor. This was a religious war: Arbogast had\\ntaken the side of the pagans; Theodosius, the victor, had Eugenius executed\\nand himself remained the sole emperor. His victory was that of the\\nCatholic church.', 'In 391 the emperor Theodosius promulgated the Edict of Milan. It\\nprohibited the practice of the ancient religion; whoever offered a sacrifice,\\nadored an idol, or entered a temple should be condemned to death as a\\nstate criminal, and his goods should be confiscated to the profit of the\\ninformer. All the pagan temples were razed to the ground or converted\\ninto Christian churches.', 'And so Theodosius was extolled by ecclesiastical\\nwriters as the model for emperors. Theodosius gave a rare example of submission to the church. The\\ninhabitants of Thessalonica had risen in riot, had killed their governor, and\\noverthrown the statues of the emperor.', 'Theodosius in irritation ordered the\\npeople to be massacred; 7,000 persons suffered death. When the emperor\\npresented himself some time after to enter the cathedral of Milan,\\nAmbrose, the bishop, charged him with his crime before all the people, and\\ndeclared that he could not give entrance to the church to a man defiled\\nwith so many murders. Theodosius confessed his sin, accepted the public\\npenance which the bishop imposed upon him, and for eight months\\nremained at the door of the church.']\n"

      "{'pos': 1, 'chunk': \"â€”Man has lived long on the earth, familiar as he was with the mammoth\\nand the cave-bear; he lived at least as early as the geological period known\\nas the Quaternary. 2. â€”Man has emerged from the savage state to civilized life; he has\\ngradually perfected his tools and his ornaments from the awkward axe of\\nflint and the necklace of bears' teeth to iron swords and jewels of gold. The\\nroughest instruments are the oldest. 3. â€”Man has made more and more rapid progress. Each age has been\\nshorter than its predecessor. CHAPTER II\\nHISTORY AND THE RECORDS\\nHISTORY\\nLegends. â€”The most ancient records of people and their doings are\\ntransmitted by oral tradition. They are recited long before they are written\\ndown and are much mixed with fable. The Greeks told how their heroes of\\nthe oldest times had exterminated monsters, fought with giants, and\\nbattled against the gods. The Romans had Romulus nourished by a wolf\\nand raised to heaven. Almost all peoples relate such stories of their infancy. But no confidence is to be placed in these legends. History. â€”History has its true beginning only with authentic accounts, that\\nis to say, accounts written by men who were well informed. This moment\\nis not the same with all peoples. The history of Egypt commences more\\nthan 3,000 years before Christ; that of the Greeks ascends scarcely to 800\\nyears before Christ; Germany has had a history only since the first century\\nof our era; Russia dates back only to the ninth century; certain savage tribes\\neven yet have no history. Great Divisions of History. â€”The history of civilization begins with the\\noldest civilized people and continues to the present time. Antiquity is the\\nmost remote period, Modern Times the era in which we live. Ancient History. â€”Ancient History begins with the oldest known nations,\\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans (about 3,000 years before our era), and\\nsurveys the peoples of the Orient, the Hindoos, Persians, PhÅ“nicians, Jews,\\nGreeks, and last of all the Romans. It terminates about the fifth century\\nA. D. , when the Roman empire of the west is extinguished. Modern History. â€”Modern History starts with the end of the fifteenth\\ncentury, with the invention of printing, the discovery of America and of the\\nIndies, the Renaissance of the sciences and arts. It concerns itself especially\\nwith peoples of the West, of Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Russia, and\\nAmerica. The Middle Age. â€”Between Antiquity and Modern Times about ten\\ncenturies elapse which belong neither to ancient times (for the civilization\\nof Antiquity has perished) nor to modern (since modern civilization does\\nnot yet exist). This period we call the Middle Age. SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT\\nPEOPLES\\nThe Sources. â€”The Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans are no longer with us;\\nall the peoples of antiquity have passed away. To know their religion, their\\ncustoms, and arts we have to seek for instruction in the remains they have\\nleft us. These are books, monuments, inscriptions, and languages, and\\nthese are our means for the study of ancient civilizations. We term these\\nsources because we draw our knowledge from them. Ancient History flows\\nfrom these sources. Books. â€”Ancient peoples have left written records behind them. Some of\\nthese peoples had sacred booksâ€”for example, the Hindoos, the Persians,\\nand the Jews; the Greeks and Romans have handed down to us histories,\\npoems, speeches, philosophical treatises. But books are very far from\\nfurnishing all the information that we require. We do not possess a single\\nAssyrian or PhÅ“nician book. Other peoples have transmitted very few\\nbooks to us. The ancients wrote less than we, and so they had a smaller\\nliterature to leave behind them; and as it was necessary to transcribe all of\\nthis by hand, there was but a small number of copies of books. Further,\\nmost of these manuscripts have been destroyed or have been lost, and\\nthose which remain to us are difficult to read. The art of deciphering them\\nis called PalÃ¦ography. The Monuments. â€”Ancient peoples, like ourselves, built monuments of\\ndifferent sorts: palaces for their kings, tombs for the dead, fortresses,\\nbridges, aqueducts, triumphal arches. Of these monuments many have\\nfallen into ruin, have been razed, shattered by the enemy or by the people\\nthemselves. But some of them survive, either because there was no desire\\nto destroy them, or because men could not. They still stand in ruins like the\\nold castles, for repairs are no longer made; but enough is preserved to\\nenable us to comprehend their former condition. Some of them are still\\nabove ground, like the pyramids, the temples of Thebes and of the island of\\nPhilÃ¦, the palace of Persepolis in Persia, the Parthenon in Greece, the\\nColosseum in Rome, and the Maison CarrÃ©e and Pont du Gard in France. Like any modern monument, these are visible to the traveller. But the\\nmajority of these monuments have been recovered from the earth, from\\nsand, from river deposits, and from dÃ©bris. One must disengage them from\\nthis thick covering, and excavate the soil, often to a great depth. Assyrian\\npalaces may be reached only by cutting into the hills. A trench of forty feet\\nis necessary to penetrate to the tombs of the kings of MycenÃ¦. Time is not\\nthe only agency for covering these ruins; men have aided it. When the\\nancients wished to build, they did not, as we do, take the trouble to level\\noff the space, nor to clear the site. Instead of removing the dÃ©bris, they\\nheaped it together and built above it. The new edifice in turn fell into ruins\\nand its dÃ©bris was added to that of more remote time; thus there were\\nformed several strata of remains. When Schliemann excavated the site of\\nTroy, he had passed through five beds of dÃ©bris; these were five ruined\\nvillages one above another, the oldest at a depth of fifty feet. By accident one town has been preserved to us in its entirety. In 79 A. D. the\\nvolcano of Vesuvius belched forth a torrent of liquid lava and a rain of\\nashes, and two Roman cities were suddenly buried, Herculaneum by lava,\\nand Pompeii by ashes; the lava burnt the objects it touched, while the ashes\\nenveloped them, preserving them from the air and keeping them intact. As\\nwe remove the ashes, Pompeii reappears to us just as it was eighteen\\ncenturies ago. One still sees the wheel-ruts in the pavement, the designs\\ntraced on the walls with charcoal; in the houses, the pictures, the utensils,\\nthe furniture, even the bread, the nuts, and olives, and here and there the\\nskeleton of an inhabitant surprised by the catastrophe. Monuments teach\\nusmuch about the ancient peoples. The science of monuments is called\\nArchÃ¦ology. Inscriptions. â€”By inscriptions one means all writings other than books. Inscriptions are for the most part cut in stone, but some are on plates of\\nbronze. At Pompeii they have been found traced on the walls in colors or\\nwith charcoal. Some have the character of commemorative inscriptions just\\nas these are now attached to our statues and edifices; thus in the\\nmonument of Ancyra the emperor Augustus publishes the story of his life. The greatest number of inscriptions are epitaphs graven on tombs. Certain\\nothers fill the function of our placards, containing, as they do, a law or a\\nregulation that was to be made public. The science of inscriptions is called\\nEpigraphy. Languages. â€”The languages also which ancient peoples spoke throw light\\non their history. Comparing the words of two different languages, we\\nperceive that the two have a common originâ€”an evidence that the peoples\\nwho spoke them were descended from the same stock. The science of\\nlanguages is called Linguistics. LacunÃ¦. â€”It is not to be supposed that books, monuments, inscriptions,\\nand languages are sufficient to give complete knowledge of the history of\\nantiquity. They present many details which we could well afford to lose,\\nbut often what we care most to know escapes us. Scholars continue to dig\\nand to decipher; each year new discoveries of inscriptions and monuments\\nare made; but there remain still many gaps in our knowledge and probably\\nsome of these will always exist.\", 'embedding': array([ 1.07924747e+00,  1.53791666e+00, -2.33485031e+00, -1.55146933e+00,\n",

These are dug up by the thousand in all the\\nprovinces of France, in Switzerland, in England, in all Europe; they are\\nfound even in Asia and Africa. It is probable that they exist in all parts of\\nthe world. These remains are called prehistoric because they are more ancient than\\nwritten history. For about fifty years men have been engaged in recovering\\nand studying them. Today most museums have a hall, or at least, some\\ncases filled with these relics. A museum at Saint-German-en-Laye, near\\nParis, is entirely given up to prehistoric remains. In Denmark is a collection\\nof more than 30,000 objects. Every day adds to the discoveries as\\nexcavations are made, houses built, and cuts made for railroads. These objects are not found on the surface of the ground, but ordinarily\\nburied deeply where the earth has not been disturbed. They are recovered\\nfrom a stratum of gravel or clay which has been deposited gradually and\\nhas fixed them in place safe from the air, a sure proof that they have been\\nthere for a long time. Prehistoric Science. â€”Scholars have examined the dÃ©bris and have asked\\nthemselves what men have left them. From their skeletons, they have tried\\nto construct their physical appearance; from their tools, the kind of life they\\nled. They have determined that these instruments resemble those used by\\ncertain savages today. The study of all these objects constitutes a new\\nscience, Prehistoric ArchÃ¦ology. The Four Ages. â€”Prehistoric remains come down to us from very diverse\\nraces of men; they have been deposited in the soil at widely different\\nepochs since the time when the mammoth lived in western Europe, a sort\\nof gigantic elephant with woolly hide and curved tusks. This long lapse of\\ntime may be divided into four periods, called Ages:\\n1. The Rough Stone Age. 2. The Polished Stone Age. 3. The Bronze Age. 4. The Iron Age. The periods take their names from the materials used in the manufacture of\\nthe tools,â€”stone, bronze, iron. These epochs, however, are of very unequal\\nlength. It may be that the Rough Stone Age was ten times as long as the\\nAge of Iron. THE ROUGH STONE AGE\\nGravel DÃ©bris. â€”The oldest remains of the Stone Age have been found in\\nthe gravels. A French scholar found between 1841 and 1853, in the valley of\\nthe Somme, certain sharp instruments made of flint. They were buried to a\\ndepth of six metres in gravel under three layers of clay, gravel, and marl\\nwhich had never been broken up. In the same place they discovered bones\\nof cattle, deer, and elephants. For a long time people made light of this\\ndiscovery. They said that the chipping of the flints was due to chance. At\\nlast, in 1860, several scholars came to study the remains in the valley of the\\nSomme and recognized that the flints had certainly been cut by men. Since\\nthen there have been found more than 5,000 similar flints in strata of the\\nsame order either in the valley of the Seine or in England, and some of\\nthem by the side of human bones. There is no longer any doubt that men\\nwere living at the epoch when the gravel strata were in process of\\nformation. If the strata that cover these remains have always been\\ndeposited as slowly as they are today, these men whose bones and tools we\\nunearth must have lived more than 200,000 years ago. The Cave Men. â€”Remains are also found in caverns cut in rock, often above\\na river. The most noted are those on the banks of the VÃ©zÃ¨re, but they exist\\nin many other places. Sometimes they have been used as habitations and\\neven as graves for men. Skeletons, weapons, and tools are found here\\ntogether. There are axes, knives, scrapers, lance-points of flint; arrows,\\nharpoon-points, needles of bone like those used by certain savages to this\\nday. The soil is strewn with the bones of animals which these men, untidy\\nlike all savages, threw into a corner after they had eaten the meat; they\\neven split the bones to extract the marrow just as savages do now. Among\\nthe animals are found not only the hare, the deer, the ox, the horse, the\\nsalmon, but also the rhinoceros, the cave-bear, the mammoth, the elk, the\\nbison, the reindeer, which are all extinct or have long disappeared from\\nFrance. Some designs have been discovered engraved on the bone of a\\nreindeer or on the tusk of a mammoth. One of these represents a combat of\\nreindeer; another a mammoth with woolly hide and curved tusks. Doubtless these men were the contemporaries of the mammoth and the\\nreindeer. They were, like the Esquimaux of our day, a race of hunters and\\nfishermen, knowing how to work in flint and to kindle fires. POLISHED STONE AGE\\nLake Dwellings. â€”In 1854, Lake Zurich being very low on account of the\\nunusual dryness of the summer, dwellers on the shore of the lake found, in\\nthe mud, wooden piles which had been much eaten away, also some rude\\nutensils. These were the remains of an ancient village built over the water. Since this time more than 200 similar villages have been found in the lakes\\nof Switzerland. They have been called Lake Villages. The piles on which\\nthey rest are trunks of trees, pointed and driven into the lake-bottom to a\\ndepth of several yards. Every village required 30,000 to 40,000 of these. A wooden platform was supported by the pile work and on this were built\\nwooden houses covered with turf. Objects found by the hundred among\\nthe piles reveal the character of the life of the former inhabitants. They ate\\nanimals killed in the chaseâ€”the deer, the boar, and the elk. But they were\\nalready acquainted with such domestic animals as the ox, the goat, the\\nsheep, and the dog. They knew how to till the ground, to reap, and to grind\\ntheir grain; for in the ruins of their villages are to be found grains of wheat\\nand even fragments of bread, or rather unleavend cakes. They wore coarse\\ncloths of hemp and sewed them into garments with needles of bone. They\\nmade pottery but were very awkward in its manufacture. Their vases were\\npoorly burned, turned by hand, and adorned with but few lines. Like the\\ncave-men, they used knives and arrows of flint; but they made their axes of\\na very hard stone which they had learned to polish. This is why we call\\ntheir epoch the Polished Stone Age. They are much later than the cavemen, for they know neither the mammoth nor the rhinoceros, but still are\\nacquainted with the elk and the reindeer. Megalithic Monuments. â€”Megalith is the name given to a monument\\nformed of enormous blocks of rough stone. Sometimes the rock is bare,\\nsometimes covered with a mass of earth. The buried monument is called a\\nTumulus on account of its resemblance to a hill. When it is opened, one\\nfinds within a chamber of rock, sometimes paved with flag-stones. The\\nmonuments whose stone is above ground are of various sorts. The Dolmen,\\nor table of rock, is formed of a long stone laid flat over other stones set in\\nthe ground. The Cromlech, or stone-circle, consists of massive rocks\\narranged in a circle. The Menhir is a block of stone standing on its end. Frequently several menhirs are ranged in line. At Carnac in Brittany four\\nthousand menhirs in eleven rows are still standing. Probably there were\\nonce ten thousand of these in this locality. Megalithic monuments appear\\nby hundreds in western France, especially in Brittany; almost every hill in\\nEngland has them; the Orkney Islands alone contain more than two\\nthousand. Denmark and North Germany are studded with them; the\\npeople of the country call the tumuli the tombs of the giants. Megalithic monuments are encountered outside of Europeâ€”in India, and\\non the African coast. No one knows what people possessed the power to\\nquarry such masses and then transport and erect them. For a long time it\\nwas believed that the people were the ancient Gauls, or Celts, whence the\\nname Celtic Monuments. But why are like remains found in Africa and in\\nIndia?\\nWhen one of these tumuli still intact is opened, one always sees a skeleton,\\noften several, either sitting or reclining; these monuments, therefore, were\\nused as tombs. Arms, vases, and ornaments are placed at the side of the\\ndead. In the oldest of these tombs the weapons are axes of polished stone;\\nthe ornaments are shells, pearls, necklaces of bone or ivory; the vases are\\nvery simple, without handle or neck, decorated only with lines or with\\npoints. Calcined bones of animals lie about on the ground, the relics of a\\nfuneral repast laid in the tomb by the friends of the dead. Amidst these\\nbones we no longer find those of the reindeer, a fact which proves that\\nthese monuments were constructed after the disappearance of this animal\\nfrom western Europe, and therefore at a time subsequent to that of the lake\\nvillages. THE AGE OF BRONZE\\nBronze Age. â€”As soon as men learned to smelt metals, they preferred these\\nto stone in the manufacture of weapons. The metal first to be used was\\ncopper, easier to extract because found free, and easier to manipulate since\\nit is malleable without the application of heat. Pure copper, however, was\\nnot employed, as weapons made of it were too fragile; but a little tin was\\nmixed with it to give it more resistance. It is this alloy of copper and tin\\nthat we call bronze. Bronze Utensils. â€”Bronze was used in the manufacture of ordinary toolsâ€”\\nknives, hammers, saws, needles, fish-hooks; in the fabrication of\\nornamentsâ€”bracelets, brooches, ear-rings; and especially in the making of\\narmsâ€”daggers, lance-points, axes, and swords. These objects are found by\\nthousands throughout Europe in the mounds, under the more recent\\ndolmens, in the turf-pits of Denmark, and in rock-tombs. Near these objects\\nof bronze, ornaments of gold are often seen and, now and then, the remains\\nof a woollen garment. It cannot be due to chance that all implements of\\nbronze are similar and all are made according to the same alloy. Doubtless\\nthey revert to the same period of time and are anterior to the coming of the\\nRomans into Gaul, for they are never discovered in the midst of dÃ©bris of\\nthe Roman period. But what men used them? What people invented\\nbronze? Nobody knows. THE IRON AGE\\nIron. â€”As iron was harder to smelt and work than bronze, it was later that\\nmen learned how to use it. As soon as it was appreciated that iron was\\nharder and cut better than bronze, men preferred it in the manufacture of\\narms. In Homer's time iron is still a precious metal reserved for swords,\\nbronze being retained for other purposes. It is for this reason that many\\ntombs contain confused remains of utensils of bronze and weapons of iron. Iron Weapons. â€”These arms are axes, swords, daggers, and bucklers. They\\nare ordinarily found by the side of a skeleton in a coffin of stone or wood,\\nfor warriors had their arms buried with them. But they are found also\\nscattered on ancient battle-fields or lost at the bottom of a marsh which\\nlater became a turf-pit. There were found in a turf-pit in Schleswig in one\\nday 100 swords, 500 lances, 30 axes, 460 daggers, 80 knives, 40 stilettosâ€”\\nand all of iron. Not far from there in the bed of an ancient lake was\\ndiscovered a great boat 66 feet long, fully equipped with axes, swords,\\nlances, and knives. It is impossible to enumerate the iron implements thus found. They have\\nnot been so well preserved as the bronze, as iron is rapidly eaten away by\\nrust. At the first glance, therefore, they appear the older, but in reality are\\nmore recent. Epoch of the Iron Age. â€”The inhabitants of northern Europe knew iron\\nbefore the coming of the Romans, the first century before Christ. In an old\\ncemetery near the salt mines of Hallstadt in Austria they have opened 980\\ntombs filled with instruments of iron and bronze without finding a single\\npiece of Roman money. But the Iron Age continued under the Romans. Almost always iron objects are found accompanied by ornaments of gold\\nand silver, by Roman pottery, funeral urns, inscriptions, and Roman coins\\nbearing the effigy of the emperor. The warriors whom we find lying near\\ntheir sword and their buckler lived for the most part in a period quite close\\nto ours, many under the Merovingians, some even at the time of\\nCharlemagne. The Iron Age is no longer a prehistoric age. CONCLUSIONS\\nHow the Four Ages are to be Conceived. â€”The inhabitants of one and the\\nsame country have successively made use of rough stone, polished stone,\\nbronze, and iron. But all countries have not lived in the same age at the\\nsame time. Iron was employed by the Egyptians while yet the Greeks were\\nin their bronze age and the barbarians of Denmark were using stone. The\\nconclusion of the polished stone age in America came only with the arrival\\nof Europeans. In our own time the savages of Australia are still in the\\nrough stone age. In their settlements may be found only implements of\\nbone and stone similar to those used by the cave-men. The four ages,\\ntherefore, do not mark periods in the life of humanity, but only epochs in\\nthe civilization of each country. Uncertainties. â€”Prehistoric archÃ¦ology is yet a very young science. We\\nhave learned something of primitive men through certain remains\\npreserved and discovered by chance. A recent accident, a trench, a landslip,\\na drought may effect a new discovery any day. Who knows what is still\\nunder ground? The finds are already innumerable. But these rarely tell us\\nwhat we wish to know. How long was each of the four ages? When did\\neach begin and end in the various parts of the world? Who planned the\\ncaverns, the lake villages, the mounds, the dolmens? When a country\\npasses from polished stone to bronze, is it the same people changing\\nimplements, or is it a new people come on the scene? When one thinks one\\nhas found the solution, a new discovery often confounds the archÃ¦ologists. It was thought that the Celts originated the dolmens, but these have been\\nfound in sections which could never have been traversed by Celts. What has been determined. â€”Three conclusions, however, seem certain:\\n1.\",\n",

      "['The Sea. â€”Greece is a land of shores: smaller than Portugal, it has as great a\\ncoast-line as Spain. The sea penetrates it to a great number of gulfs, coves,\\nand indentations; it is ordinarily surrounded with projecting rocks, or with\\napproaching islands that form a natural port. This sea is like a lake; it has\\nnot, like the ocean, a pale and sombre color; usually it is calm, lustrous,\\nand, as Homer says, \"of the color of violets. \"\\nNo sea lends itself better to navigation with small ships. Every morning the\\nnorth wind rises to conduct the barques of Athens to Asia; in the evening\\nthe south wind brings them back to port. From Greece to Asia Minor the\\nislands are placed like stepping-stones; on a clear day the mariner always\\nhas land in view. Such a sea beckons people to cross it. And so the Greeks have been sailors, traders, travellers, pirates, and\\nadventurers; like the PhÅ“nicians, they have spread over all the ancient\\nworld, carrying with them the merchandise and the inventions of Egypt, of\\nChaldea, and of Asia. The Climate. â€”The climate of Greece is mild. In Athens it freezes hardly\\nonce in twenty years; in summer the heat is moderated by the breeze from\\nthe sea. Today the people still lie in the streets from the month of May to\\nSeptember. The air is cool and transparent; for many leagues could once be\\nseen the crest of the statue of Pallas. The contours of distant mountains are\\nnot, as with us, enveloped in haze, but show a clear line against the clear\\nsky. It is a beautiful country which urges man to take life as a feast, for\\neverything is happy about him. \"Walking at night in the gardens, listening\\nto the grasshoppers, playing the lute in the clear of the moon, going to\\ndrink at the spring at the mountain, carrying with him some wine that he\\nmay drink while he sings, spending the days in dancingâ€”these are Greek\\npleasures, the joys of a race poor, economical, and eternally young. \"\\nSimplicity of Greek Life. â€”In this country men are not melted with the heat\\nnor stiffened with cold; they live in the open air gay and at slight expense. Food in great quantity is not required, nor warm clothing, nor a\\ncomfortable house. The Greek could live on a handful of olives and a\\nsardine.']\n",

      "{'summary': 'The Iron Age began when people learned to use iron, which was harder and better than bronze. Iron weapons like axes, swords, and daggers were used by warriors who buried them with their skeletons. The Iron Age continued under Roman rule, but it's not a prehistoric age anymore since many of these artifacts are found near Roman coins and pottery. The four ages - rough stone, polished stone, bronze, and iron - don't mark periods in humanity's life, but rather epochs in the civilization of each country.'}\n",
      "{'summary': 'The text describes Buddha's teachings on love, fraternity, and tolerance. He preached to his disciples that they should love even those who do them ill, and that all men are equal regardless of their social status or caste. Buddha received disciples from all walks of life, including street-sweepers, beggars, and even murderers and thieves. He emphasized the importance of charity, chastity, and beneficence, and believed that benevolence is the first of virtues. The text also touches on the later history of Buddhism, which was established about 500 years before Christ and spread to various parts of Asia through missionaries. Over time, Buddhism underwent changes, including the formation of communities of monks who renounced their family and took vows of poverty and chastity. These religious groups eventually developed a complex theology and became powerful, leading them to esteem themselves above the rest of the faithful.'}\n",
      "{ 'summary' : \"The chapter discusses the limitations of knowledge about ancient history, citing gaps in our understanding and new discoveries being made. It then moves on to describe Greece as a small country with varied terrain, rocky mountains, and limited arable land. The chapter also compares Assyrian art to that of the Greeks, noting the use of crude brick, stone facings, and sculptural alabaster, as well as the depiction of scenes and animals in bas-reliefs.\" }\n",
      "{'summary': \"The Pariahs, considered outcasts, were forced to live on the fringes of society, possessing only dogs and asses, wearing garments made from the dead, and constantly moving from place to place. In contrast, the Brahmans held a dominant position in Indian society, being considered the first among men and even above warriors and kings. They were responsible for knowing and teaching religion, living off donations from others, and preserving their Aryan heritage through endogamy. The Brahmans also developed a new god, Brahma, who was seen as the supreme deity, the soul of the universe, and the source of all life. This concept is tied to the idea of transmigration of souls, where souls pass from one body to another, with good souls rising to heaven and evil souls falling into hell, until they eventually return to their original state.\"}\n",
      "{'summary': Greece is a land surrounded by shores, with a sea that is calm, lustrous, and inviting to navigation. The climate is mild, with minimal freezing temperatures and a clear sky that allows for distant mountain contours to be seen. This leads to a simple and carefree way of life, where people can enjoy the outdoors without needing much food, clothing, or shelter. The Greeks have been sailors, traders, and travelers, spreading their culture and inventions across the ancient world, and their pleasures include walking at night, playing music under the moonlight, and dancing in the open air.'}\n",
      "{'summary': 'The text discusses various philosophical and spiritual concepts from Eastern and Western traditions. It describes the life of Buddha, who renounced worldly pleasures to seek enlightenment and established Buddhism after 45 years of preaching. The text also explores the concept of Nirvana, where one achieves a state of supreme intelligence and infinite might. Additionally, it touches on the idea of transmigration of souls in Hinduism, where souls pass from one body to another until they reach the highest sphere and are absorbed into Brahma. Finally, it mentions the lives of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, who were influential figures in Western philosophy.'}\n",
      "{'summary': 'The text discusses the monuments and inscriptions of ancient civilizations, specifically the Assyrian empire and its capital Nineveh. It describes the city's layout, walls, and palaces, as well as the cuneiform writing system used by the Assyrians. The text also touches on the concept of multiple worlds and universes in ancient Eastern thought, and briefly mentions Buddhism, including its evolution from honoring Buddha as a perfect man to deifying him and inventing mechanical prayer devices. Finally, it introduces the Persian Empire and its religion, Zoroastrianism.'}\n",
      "{'summary': 'The Roman Empire was founded after a century of civil wars and revolutions, with the government of the Senate giving way to the government of generals. The Gracchi brothers attempted to take power from the nobles, but ultimately failed. The need for peace led to the rise of Octavian, who became emperor without having the title, bringing an end to the civil wars and establishing a strong central authority.'}\n",
      "{'summary': 'The Assyrian Empire was known for its brutal tactics, including cutting off ears and flaying people alive. The empire began with the capture of Babylon around 1270 and lasted until it was destroyed by the Babylonians and Medes in 625. The Babylonian Empire, also known as the Second Chaldean Empire, rose to power after the fall of Assyria and was characterized by its martial and victorious people. However, this empire was short-lived and was overthrown by the Persians in 538 B.C. The city of Babylon was a fortified camp with thick walls and a large ditch filled with water. It was surrounded by fields for cultivation and had impressive architecture, including the Tower of Babylon.'}\n",
      "{'summary': The Spartans were known for their discipline, with warriors living in barracks and engaging in war until they were 60 years old. They had a strict code of conduct, including a focus on physical training and a lack of personal freedom. Despite this, they were proud and laconic, speaking in short phrases. Their country was harsh and unforgiving, with extreme temperatures and violent winds, but also fertile valleys along the rivers where fruits and pastures thrived.\n",
      "{'summary': 'The text discusses various philosophical and spiritual concepts from Eastern and Western traditions. It describes the life of Buddha, who renounced worldly pleasures to seek enlightenment and established Buddhism after 45 years of preaching. The text also explores the concept of Nirvana, where one achieves a state of supreme intelligence and infinite might. Additionally, it touches on the idea of transmigration of souls in Hinduism, where souls pass from one body to another until they reach the highest sphere and are absorbed into Brahma. Finally, it mentions the lives of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, who were influential figures in Western philosophy.'}\n"
